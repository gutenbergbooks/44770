<h2>DAISY'S WORK.</h2>




<h2>I.<br />

<small>THE LITTLE FLOWER-GIRL.</small></h2>


<div class='drop-cap'>THERE stood our Daisy. What
a Daisy it was too; what a fair,
sweet floweret; pure and innocent-looking
as the blossoms over which
she bent. There she stood beside
her basket of flowers, a little spot of
brightness and beauty amidst all the
dust and heat and turmoil of the
noisy street, on that warm summer
afternoon.</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span></p>

<p>It was a street which ran beside a
great railroad depot. Porters, carmen,
and hackmen were calling, shouting,
and swearing; passengers were
hurrying by to catch the trains which
were starting every few minutes; carriages
driving up with their loads of
ladies and children; and farther down
the street were great trucks laden
with freight, and express-wagons filled
with baggage, which the railroad
porters were unloading with a great
amount of noise and crash; and
amongst it all was Daisy, standing
opposite the door of the ladies' entrance.</p>

<p>But not one of all those passers-by
knew that she was a "Daisy," or
that those were her namesakes which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
she held so lovingly in her little
hands. Now and then one stopped
to buy one of the five or ten cent bouquets,
so tastefully arranged, which
lay in her basket; and almost all who
did so had a kind word to give the
child; for there was something in her
look and air which pleaded for tenderness
and sympathy. It did not
seem that this was her proper place;
for even in her homely dress she
looked so dainty and delicate, and
moved and spoke so like a little lady,
that it was easy to see that she had
been accustomed to a different kind
of life. But all who noticed her, or
stopped to buy her flowers, were in
such haste that none had time for
more than a passing interest in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
child, and contented themselves with
wondering and pitying.</p>

<p>Down the street came a lady with
a little girl, the latter skipping and
jumping as she held her mother's
hand. No wonder the little one was
happy, and as full of play and merry
pranks as any kitten; for she had
been spending such a pleasant day
with mamma in the city, and was
now going back with "such lots to
tell about and heaps of pretty things"
to her own lovely country home.</p>

<p>"Oh, see, mamma!" she said, as
her eye fell upon the other child,
"see those pretty flowers that dear
little girl is selling. She is just about
as large as Lola Swan, and <i>don't</i>
she look nice and sweet. Won't<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
you buy some flowers from her,
mamma?"</p>

<p>"You have plenty of flowers at
home, dear Lily, and we have about
as much as we can carry now," answered
her mother.</p>

<p>"Oh, dear mamma, but those little
brenkays" (bouquets, Lily meant)
"would take up such a tiny mite of
room, and I want you to buy some
for kindness to the little girl. She
looks so sorry out of her eyes, mamma."</p>

<p>Moved by the pleadings of her
little daughter, Mrs. Ward turned
toward the flower-girl, whom in her
hurry she had nearly passed without
a look, and asked the price of her
bouquets.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span></p>

<p>"What a pretty pot of daisies!
Can't I have that, mamma?" asked
Lily.</p>

<p>But at this the flower-girl drew
back and put one hand over the pot
of daisies she held in the other, as if
she feared it was to be taken from
her by force.</p>

<p>"I'll ask papa to carry them for
me, mamma," said Lily.</p>

<p>"Ho! ho!" said a cheery voice
behind her, "so you think papa has
nothing better to do than turn expressman
and carry all your traps, do you?
I wonder how many bundles are already
waiting in the depot for me to
put safely in the cars;" and turning
about Lily saw her father, who had
overtaken his wife and little girl.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh! lots and lots!" said Lily,
jumping about with new glee as she
saw him. "We bought something
for everybody, papa; and I bought a
present for your birthday to-morrow;
but it is a secret. Mamma is going
to fill it with ink and I'll put it on
your writing-table 'fore you come
down in the morning; but you won't
ask what it is, will you?"</p>

<p>"Not on any account," said Mr.
Ward. "But you must make haste
and buy your flowers, or we shall not
find good seats in the cars. So you
want these daisies, do you? How
much are they, my child?"</p>

<p>But again the flower-girl drew back.</p>

<p>"I couldn't sell them, sir," she said;
"at least not now, not if,&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh! they are for some favorite
customer, hey? You see, Lily, you
can't have them. Well, pick out
your bouquets; we'll hang them about
our necks if we can't carry them any
other way," said Mr. Ward. "This
is the little girl I told you about, my
dear," turning to his wife, who had
been looking at the sweet, sad face
of the young flower vender.</p>

<p>"What is your name, my child?"
asked the lady.</p>

<p>"My name is&mdash;they call me Margaret,"
said the child, with hesitation
in her voice and manner, and a sudden
flush breaking over her face.</p>

<p>"There," said Mr. Ward, when,
having paid for the flowers which
Lily had chosen, he hurried his wife<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
and daughter away; "there, my dear,
I did not say too much about that
child, did I?"</p>

<p>"Why no," said Mrs. Ward, looking
back to the small figure beside its
basket of flowers, "there is certainly
something very interesting about her.
Her speech and manner, as well as
her looks, are strangely refined and
lady-like for one in her position. I
wish we had time to talk more to
her."</p>

<p>The flower-girl looked after them
and sighed,&mdash;a long, weary sigh, as
she watched the frolicsome Lily.</p>

<p>"Most all little girls have their fathers
and mothers," she said softly to
herself; "but I don't have either. I
wonder why God did take both of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
mine away; if He didn't know how
lonesome I would be, or why He
didn't take me too. I don't see what
good I can be to Him all alone by
myself, except Betty and Jack. But
then He knows, and maybe He only
wants me to be patient till He's ready
to take me."</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 347px;">
<img src="images/i-023.jpg" width="347" height="465" alt="boy and girl and woman" />
</div>

<p>But the wistful eyes brightened
again, as, having watched Lily and
her friends disappear within the door
of the depot, she turned them the
other way to see if new customers
were coming.</p>

<p>"There he comes," she said, as her
eye fell upon a tall, broad-shouldered
gentleman coming down the street,
"soldier" written in every line and
motion of his figure, from the erect,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
stately head, down to the ringing,
military tread of his firm foot.</p>

<p>"Good afternoon, little woman,"
he said, returning with a pleasant
smile her welcoming look; "is my
wife's bouquet all ready?"</p>

<p>Taking from the corner of her
basket a bouquet somewhat larger
than the rest, and of rather choicer
flowers, she held it up to him.</p>

<p>"Thank you, sir," she said, as she
received the price; and then, with
rising color, added, "would it be too
much trouble to carry this to the
lady?"</p>

<p>"Too much trouble? No! How
much is it?" he said, putting his hand
again into his pocket.</p>

<p>"Oh! sir, I didn't mean that. I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
didn't want to sell it, but to give it
to you, if you would take it to the
lady you buy flowers for every day.
I want to send it to her because you
are so kind to me, and because&mdash;because
you put me in mind of&mdash;of
somebody."</p>

<p>"That is it, is it?" said the gentleman.
"Well, I can't refuse such a
pretty gift, so prettily offered. And
who do I put you in mind of, pray?"</p>

<p>"Of my papa, sir. You do look
like him."</p>

<p>"Humph!" said the gentleman,
not much pleased at the idea that he
was like the father of this little poor
child, above her station though she
looked. "And these are daisies, hey?
My wife will like them."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span></p>

<p>"General, do you mean to miss the
train?" said an acquaintance, as he
passed.</p>

<p>"Not with my own consent, certainly,"
said the gentleman. "I shall
thank you for the lady to-morrow,
my little girl."</p>

<p>But as he turned to go, his foot
slipped upon a piece of orange-peel,
thrown down by some careless person,
and he had nearly fallen. He
would have been down altogether but
for his little companion; but as he
involuntarily put out his hand, she
caught it; and that support, frail and
slight as it was, was sufficient to
steady him.</p>

<p>Kind of heart, noble and generous
though he was, the soldier was hasty-tempered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
and quick, and an oath&mdash;a
fearful oath&mdash;burst from his lips.</p>

<p>"Ah, you were my good angel.
You have saved me from a bad fall,"
he said almost in the same breath,
but in a very different tone and manner,
as he turned to the child.</p>

<p>His good angel! Ah, yes! More
than he knew, his good angel. Those
little hands should from this time hold
him from falling into the sin of which
he had just been guilty.</p>

<p>Years ago General Forster would
have been shocked at the thought
of letting such words escape his
lips, though even then he was none
too reverent or careful in speaking of
sacred persons or things; but in the
bustle and excitement of war he had,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
alas! like many another brave man,
allowed himself to fall into the habit
of taking God's holy name in vain.
But careless though he might be
before men in moments of forgetfulness,
or when his hasty temper got
the better of him, he seldom or never
suffered himself to use such words
before women or children; why, you
shall learn.</p>

<p>"Why, have I hurt you?" he asked,
seeing with surprise her startled
and troubled face.</p>

<p>"No, sir, oh! no," she answered,
catching her breath, "but, but"&mdash;</p>

<p>"Well, but what?"</p>

<p>"But I am so sorry;" and that she
was so was proved, as she covered
her face with her hands and burst
into tears.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span></p>

<p>"Sorry for what?" he asked.</p>

<p>She gave him no answer, but shrank
a little away.</p>

<p>"Sorry for what?" he repeated, as
if determined to know; and the tone
of command, which seemed to say
he was used to instant obedience,
forced her to speak, whether she
would or no.</p>

<p>"Sorry for those words you said,
sir," she sobbed.</p>

<p>"Those words? What words?"
But his question answered itself as it
was spoken; for his wicked words,
which but for this would have been
forgotten the next instant, came back
to him, and he stood rebuked before
this poor little flower-girl. He repented
already; but repented only<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
because he had distressed this simple
child, in whom he took so much interest,
not yet because he had grieved
and offended the Holy One whose
name he had profaned.</p>

<p>Still he was vexed too.</p>

<p>"Why, you don't mean to say," he
said rather impatiently, "that you
never hear such words as those,
standing here as you do, half the day,
with those rough men and boys about
you?"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, sir!" she said, plaintively.
"I do hear such words, often,
often. I try not to; but I can't help
it, you see; and it makes me so sorry.
But I thought those poor men and
boys could not know how to read,
and had never been taught better,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
or perhaps they did not know what
God had said in His commandments.
But I did not think gentlemen said
such things; and I liked you <i>so</i>
much."</p>

<p>And did she like him less now?
He, the <i>gentleman</i>, the rich man, felt
that he could not wish to lose the respect
and liking of this little child
whom he thought so far beneath him,
and he was ashamed and sorry. He
knew that it was not impertinence,
but only her innocent simplicity and
truthfulness, which had caused her to
say what she did. But to know that
he was in the wrong and to acknowledge
it, were one and the same thing
with this true-hearted man.</p>

<p>"You are right, Margaret," he said,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
forgetting how fast the moments were
flying. "<i>Gentlemen</i> should not say
such things, especially before ladies
and children. It is bad manners;
but I forgot myself just then."</p>

<p>She took her hands from her face
and looked up at him. There was
an unspoken question in the clear,
earnest eyes, and it was plain that
she was not yet satisfied.</p>

<p>"Well," he said smiling at her,
"what troubles you still? Let me
have it all."</p>

<p>"I was only thinking what difference
could it make, sir."</p>

<p>"What difference could what
make?"</p>

<p>"Whether it was ladies and children
who heard it, sir," she answered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
timidly. "God hears it all the same,
doesn't He? And it can't make any
difference to Him who else hears it."</p>

<p>She looked up as she spoke at the
blue sky overhead, and the look and
the words brought to him a sudden
sense of God's constant presence and
nearness. He had known it well
enough before,&mdash;that the Almighty
Eye saw him always; that the Almighty
Ear heard him always; but he
had never felt it as he did now. The
gentle, timid reproof had gone far
deeper than the little giver had intended,
and her hearer felt ashamed
that he had confessed to her that he
would pay a respect to a woman or
child which he did not feel it needful
to pay to his Maker. He could make
her no answer.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span></p>

<p>"<i>You</i> behind time, General?" said
the voice of another friend as he hurried
past; and the scream of the
warning whistle told the gentleman
that he had no time to lose.</p>

<p>"I'll see you to-morrow. Good-by,
my child. God bless you," he
said hurriedly, and rushed away.</p>

<p>But just in time; he was the last
passenger, and stepped upon the platform
of a car as the train was put in
motion. The jar threw him once
more a little off his balance, and he
caught by the rail to save himself,
while again hasty, profane words rose
to his lips.</p>

<p>But they did not pass them. What
though no human ear should hear;
"God heard them all the same," and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
they were checked before even the
summer wind could catch them; and
in their place the angels carried up
the heart-breathed prayer, "God keep
me from them in time to come."</p>

<p>His next neighbor in the cars
thought General Forster remarkably
silent and unsociable that afternoon.
He would not talk, but buried himself
behind his newspaper. If the
neighbor had looked closer he would
have seen that the General's eyes
were fixed, not on the paper held before
his face, but on the little pot of
daisies which rested on his knee.
And over the delicate pink and white
blossoms was breathed a vow,&mdash;a
vow registered in heaven and faithfully
kept on earth.</p>

<small>A CLUSTER OF DAISIES.</small></h2>


<div class='drop-cap'>"WHAT are you thinking of,
Frank?" said Mrs. Forster,
looking at her husband as he stood
leaning against the casing of the window,
gazing thoughtfully out at the
lovely garden beyond.</div>

<p>"Of a bad habit of mine," he answered.</p>

<p>"You have none; at least none
that I cannot put up with," she said
playfully.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span></p>

<p>"That's not the question, dear
Gertrude," he returned gravely. "It
is whether my Maker can put up with
it, and I believe that He cannot, since
he has said He 'will not hold him
guiltless that taketh His name in
vain.'"</p>

<p>Mrs. Forster colored as she bent
her head over the sleeping baby on
her lap.</p>

<p>"You did not know, perhaps," her
husband said, after a minute's silence,
"that I was ever guilty of this&mdash;sin?"</p>

<p>"I did know it, Frank; at least I
have heard you now and then, when
you were speaking to your dogs and
horses, or even when you were a
little impatient with the men. But
you did not mean me to hear such<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
words; and I noticed you never used
them in my presence."</p>

<p>"No," he said a little sadly: "I
would not speak in my wife's presence
words which were not fit for
her to hear; but I forgot an ear still
purer, which I was insulting and defying.
That is the second thrust I
have had to-day, Gertrude, which has
made me feel that I have treated the
Almighty with less of reverence and
respect than I would show to some
of my fellow-creatures. Let me tell
you of the innocent lesson I received
from the little flower-girl, who sent
the daisies to you."</p>

<p>And sitting down beside her, he
told her of the teaching which had
come to him from the little wayside<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
blossom; to whose lonely, thirsting
heart his few kind words and smiles
had been as drops of dew from
heaven.</p>

<p>But even while they talked of her
and her pretty lady-like ways and
sayings, which seemed so far above
her station, they did not know she
was a "Daisy," and that those were
her namesakes over which Mrs. Forster
bent, dropping happy tears and
kisses on them, mingled with many a
blessing on the little giver.</p>

<p>Plucking one of the flowers from
the stem, she opened her baby's tiny
hand and placed it within it. The
fairy fingers closed around it, clasping
it tight, while the unconscious little
one slept on.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span></p>

<p>"Her name is Gertrude, but we'll
call her Daisy, Frank, as soon as
she is old enough to be called any
thing but baby," said the young
mother, "and her pretty pet name may
serve as a reminder of this day's lesson,
if ever it should be forgotten."</p>

<p>"You think I may need it," said
her husband, smiling. "I trust not;
for the sin, to say nothing of the vulgarity,
of taking God's name in vain,
has been set forth so plainly by my
innocent little teacher, that I must
have a short memory, indeed, if I
failed to remember her lesson. She
thought <i>gentlemen</i> must know better."</p>

<p>"But, dear," said the lady, "you
said you would inquire about this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
child, and see if we could not be of
some use to her."</p>

<p>"So I did," he answered; "and so I
will, and should have done long since;
but day after day I have let business
or pleasure keep me till I had but just
time to catch the train, and none to
bestow on the poor little creature
who seems to have been so grateful
for the few kind words I have given
her. You think I am rather fanciful
about this child, I know, Gertrude;
but I am convinced that some of her
few years must have been spent
among different people than those by
whom she is now surrounded. Nor
am I the only one of her customers
who has noticed the grace of her
speech and manners, so uncommon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
in a child of her class. Ward, and
others beside, have seen it; but like
myself have never made it their business
to see after her. However, to-morrow
afternoon, I shall make it a
point to be at the depot in time to
have a talk with her. I wonder if
the woman who keeps the fruit-stall
at the corner, and whose child I believe
she is, would give her up and
let her go to school."</p>

<p>He was as good as his word; and
more than an hour earlier than usual,
our little flower-girl saw "her gentleman"
coming down the street towards
the depot. It was an eager,
wistful little face, with some questioning
fear in it, that she raised to him,
for she was anxious lest she should<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
have offended her kind friend, as she
had learned to think him, by her
plain speech of the day before.</p>

<p>She had scarcely meant to speak
so plainly; the words had seemed to
escape her without her intending it,
and, it was true, had been drawn forth
by the gentleman's own questions;
but when she remembered them afterwards
she feared that he would think
her rude and disrespectful.</p>

<p>She need not have been afraid.
His eye and voice were even kinder
than usual as he came near to her,
and he laid his hand gently on her
head, saying,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Well, my little woman! and how
does the world go with you to-day?
The lady told me to thank you very
much for the daisies."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span></p>

<p>The young face brightened.</p>

<p>"Did she like them, sir?"</p>

<p>"Very much indeed,&mdash;all the more
because she has a little one at home
whom she is going to call 'Daisy'
after your pretty flowers."</p>

<p>"Is she your little girl, sir?"</p>

<p>"Yes, she is a mite of a Daisy, but
a very precious one," he answered;
then looking into the flushed face,
with its soft, shining eyes and parted
lips, he added, "You are a Daisy
yourself."</p>

<p>The flowers she held dropped at
her feet unheeded as she clasped both
hands upon her breast, and with quick-coming
breath and filling eyes, asked
eagerly, "How <i>did</i> you know it, sir?
how did you know it?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span></p>

<p>"Know what, my child? What
troubles you?"</p>

<p>"How did you know I was Daisy?"
she almost gasped.</p>

<p>"I did not know it," he answered
in surprise. "Is your name Daisy?
I thought it was Margaret."</p>

<p>"They call me Margaret, sir,&mdash;Betty
and Jack; but Daisy is my <i>own</i>,
<i>own</i> name, that papa and mamma
called me," she answered, recovering
herself a little.</p>

<p>"And where are your papa and
mamma?" he asked. "I thought the
woman who keeps the fruit-stall at
the corner was your mother."</p>

<p>"Oh, no, sir!" she said. "She is
only Betty. She is very good to me,
but she is not mamma. Mamma was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
a lady," she added, with simple, childish
dignity, which told that she was
a lady herself.</p>

<p>"But <i>where</i> are your father and
mother?" he repeated, with fresh interest
in the child.</p>

<p>"Mamma is drowned, sir; and we
could never find papa," she answered,
with such pathos in her tones.</p>

<p>"Come into the depot with me,"
said General Forster: "I want to talk
to you."</p>

<p>She obeyed, and, taking up her
basket, followed him into the waiting-room,
where, heedless of the many
curious eyes around, he made her sit
down beside him, and drew from her
her sad, simple story:&mdash;how long,
long ago she had lived with papa and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
mamma and her little brother and
baby sister in their own lovely home,
far away from here; where it was,
she did not know, but in quite a different
place from the great bustling
city which she had never seen
till she came here with Betty and
Jack; how she had left home with
mamma and the baby on a great ship,
where to go she could not remember;
how Betty was on board, and
mamma had been kind to her; how
a dreadful storm had come and there
was great confusion and terror; and
then it seemed as if she went to sleep
for a long, long time, and knew nothing
more till she found herself living
with Betty and Jack in their poor
home far up in the city.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span></p>

<p>They had been very good to her,
nursing and caring for her during the
many months she had been weak and
ailing; and now that she was stronger
and better, she tried to help them
all she could, keeping the two small
rooms tidy, while Betty was away
attending to her stall; and in the
afternoon selling the flowers which
Jack raised in his little garden, and
she arranged in tasteful bouquets.
And, lastly, she told how from the
very first time she had seen General
Forster, she thought he "looked so
like papa" that she felt as if she must
love him, and was so happy when he
stopped to buy flowers of her and
spoke kindly to her.</p>

<p>The story was told with a straightforward<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
and simple pathos, which
went right to the listener's heart, and
left him no doubt of its truth. But
the child could tell nothing of her
own name or her parents', save that
she was always called "Daisy" at
home, and that she had never since
heard the familiar name until to-day,
when she thought this stranger had
given it to her. Betty and Jack always
called her "Margaret;" and
Betty thought she knew mamma's
name, but she did not. But she loved
daisies dearly for the sake of their
name, which had been her own; and
she had raised and tended with loving
care the little plant she had given to
"my gentleman" as a token of gratitude
for his kindness, and because he
was "so like papa."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span></p>

<p>Having learned all that he could
from the child herself, the gentleman
went to the fruit-woman on the
corner.</p>

<p>"So," he said, "the little girl whom
you call Margaret is not your own
daughter?"</p>

<p>"Indade, no, sir," answered Betty;
"niver a daughter of me own have I
barrin' Jack, and he's not me own at
all, but jist me sister's son what died,
lavin' him a babby on me hands.
More betoken that it's not a little
lady like her that the likes of me
would be raisin', unless she'd none
of her own to do it."</p>

<p>"Will you tell me how that came
about?"</p>

<p>Betty told the story in her turn,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
in as plain and simple a manner as
the child's, though in language far
different.</p>

<p>Her husband had been steward on
a sailing vessel running between New
Orleans and New York; and about
three years ago, she, being sick and
ordered change of air, had been allowed
to go with him for the voyage.
But it made her worse instead of
better; and on the return trip she
would have died, Betty declared, if it
had not been for the kindness and
tender nursing of a lady, "Margaret's"
mother. This lady&mdash;"her name had
been Saacyfut, she believed, but
maybe she disremembered intirely,
for Marga<i>ret</i> said it was not"&mdash;was
on her way to New York with her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
little girl who was sick, a baby, and
a French nurse; but her home was
neither there nor in New Orleans,&mdash;at
least so the child afterwards said.</p>

<p>Her own account of the storm was
the same as the child's; but while the
recollection of the little one could go
no further, Betty remembered only
too well the horrors of that day.</p>

<p>When it was found that the ship
must sink, and that all on board must
leave her, there had been, as the little
girl said, great confusion. How it
was, Betty could not exactly tell;
she had been placed in one boat, the
French nurse, with the child in her
arms, beside her; and the lady was
about to follow with the infant, when
a spar fell, striking the Frenchwoman<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
on the head and killing her instantly,
knocking overboard one of the three
sailors who were in the boat,&mdash;while
at the same time the boat was parted
from the ship and at the mercy of the
raging waves. In vain did the two
sailors who were left try to regain
the ship: they were swept further
and further away, and soon lost sight
of the vessel. They drifted about all
night, and the next morning were
taken up by a fishing-smack which
brought them to New York.</p>

<p>Fright and exposure and other
hardships, while they seemed to have
cured Betty, were too much for the
poor little girl, and a long and terrible
illness followed: after which
she lay for months, too weak to move<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
or speak, and appearing to have lost
all memory and sense. And when at
last she grew better and stronger, and
reason and recollection came back,
she could not tell the name of her
parents or her home.</p>

<p>"Marga<i>ret</i> Saacyfut," Betty persisted
in saying the French nurse had
called her little charge, "Mamsell
Marga<i>ret</i>," "and if the lady's name
wasn't Saacyfut it was mightily nigh
to it."</p>

<p>"Marguerite" had been the French
woman's name for "Daisy:" that the
General saw plainly enough, but he
could make nothing of the surname.</p>

<p>"But did you not seek for the
child's friends, Betty?" he asked.</p>

<p>"'Deed did I, sir," she answered.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
"Didn't I even ad<i>ver</i>tise her, an' how
she was to be heerd of, but all to no
good. An' I writ to New Orleans to
them what owned the ship, but they
were that oncivil they niver answered,
not they. An' it took a hape of money,
sir, to be payin' the paper, an' me such
hard work to get along, an' Marga<i>ret</i>
on me hands, an' I had to be done
with it. For ye see me man was
gone wid the ship, an' niver heerd of
along wid the rest to this day; an' I
had to use up the bit he'd put by
in the savin's bank till the child was
mendin' enough for me to lave her
wid Jack."</p>

<p>"It was a very generous thing for
you to burden yourself with the care
of her," said General Forster.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span></p>

<p>"Burden is it, sir? Niver a burden
was she, the swate lamb, not even
when the sense had left her. An'
that was what the neighbors was always
a sayin', and why didn't I put
her in the hospital. An' why would
I do that after the mother of her
savin' me from a buryin' in the say,
which I niver could abide. For sure
if it hadn't been for the lady I'd 'a
died on the ould ship, and they'd
'a chucked me overboard widout
sayin' by your lave; and sure I'd
niver have got over such a buryin' as
that all the days of me life. And
would I be turnin' out her child afther
that? An' isn't she payin' me for it
now, an' 'arnin' her livin,' an' mine
too? She an' Jack tends the bit of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
a garden, an' arternoons she comes
down an' sells her flowers, an'
where'd be the heart to refuse her
wid her pretty ways and nice manners;
a lady every inch of her, like
her mother before her."</p>

<p>And thrusting her head out from
her stall, Betty gazed down the street
with admiring affection on her young
<i>protégée</i>.</p>

<p>"Och! but she's the jewel of a
child," she went on; "and it is surprisin'
how me and Jack is improved
and become ginteel all along of her.
Ye see, sir, I did use to say a hape of
words that maybe wer'n't jist so; not
that I meant 'em for swearin', but it
was jist a way of spakin'. But after
Marga<i>ret</i> began to mend and get<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
about, ye would have thought she
was kilt intirely if I let one out of
me mouth. So seein' how it hurted
her, I jist minded what I was about,
an' Jack the same, for he was a boy
that swore awful, poor fellow; he'd
been left to himself, and how was he
to know better? At first him and me
minded our tongues, for that the child
shouldn't be hurted; but by and by
didn't she make it plain to us that it
was the great Lord himself what we
was offendin', and knowin' she'd been
tached better nor me, I jist heeded
her. And now, sir, them words that
I never thought no harm of and used
to come so aisy, I jist leave them out
of me spache widout troublin'; and a
deal better it sounds, and widout<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
doubt more plasin' to Him that's
above. And Jack the same mostly,
though he does let one slip now and
agin. So ye see, sir, it's not a burden
she is at all, at all, but jist a little bit
of light and comfort to the house that
houlds her."</p>

<p>Glad to find a listener in a "gintleman
the likes of him," Betty had
talked away to the gentlemen, so taken
up with her story, that she paid little
heed to the business of her stall.
She made wrong change more than
once, gave quarts instead of pints,
oranges in place of apples, and peanuts
for sugar-plums, and provoked
some impatient customers not a little;
while one wicked boy, seeing her attention
was taken up with something<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
else, ran off without paying for the
pop-corn he asked for, and was not
called back.</p>

<p>But Betty lost nothing by the time
and thought she had given to the
gentleman, or the interest she had
shown in her young charge, as she
found when she looked at the number
upon the note he slipped into her
hand when he left her: a note which
the warm-hearted Irishwoman laid by

<small>THE DAISY TRANSPLANTED.</small></h2>


<div class='drop-cap'>"BETTY," said General Forster,
stopping the next morning at
the fruit-woman's stall, "could you
make up your mind to give up that
little girl if you were sure it was for
her good?"</div>

<p>Betty sighed and shook her head
mournfully as she answered,&mdash;</p>

<p>"I've always looked to give her
up, sir, if them Saacyfuts, or whatever
their name'll be, turned up, and
if it was for her good, sorra a word<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
would they hear out of me, though I
won't say but it would go hard with
me and Jack. But ye'll not be tellin'
me ye've been findin' her friends since
last night, sir?"</p>

<p>"Not the people she belongs to,
certainly, Betty; but I have found
those who will be friends to her, and
provide for her, if you will consent.
She should go to school and be well
taught: do you not think so?"</p>

<p>"Indade, an' there's none knows
that better nor meself, sir. An' is it
yerself that's the friend ye're spakin'
of?" and Betty gave a searching look
into the gentleman's face.</p>

<p>He smiled. "Yes," he said: "I
would like to put her to school and
take care of her. She seems a sweet<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
child, and a good one. And you see,
Betty, I have it in my power to do
more to find her friends than you are
able to do, and we may trace them yet.
If we never find them, I will promise
to provide for her as long as it may
be necessary. Are you willing?"</p>

<p>Betty again stared into the face of
her questioner as if she would look
him through.</p>

<p>"I'm sinsible of your kindness,
sir," she answered; "but ye see I'm
in a way risponsible for the child, not
to say that she is as dear to me as me
own flesh and blood, and I'd say
'yis,' and thank ye kindly, but&mdash;ye'll
excuse me plain spakin'&mdash;ye're
a stranger to me, and I couldn't be
partin' wid Marga<i>ret</i> widout I was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
certified as to yer ka<i>rac</i>ter. For if I
didn't think she'd be brought up right,
niver a foot should she stir to go wid
ye. I seen Miss Gertrude Allston a
walkin' wid ye once last summer, sir,
jist after I set up me stand here, but
she niver heeded me wid her swate
face. But I used to be laundress in
her mother's house afore I was married,
and a swate child was Miss
Gertrude and a good as ye're sayin'
of Marga<i>ret</i>, and she'll niver go far
wrong, I'll answer for it. So, if ye'll
jist bring me a line from her and
she says ye're all right, I'll not say
ye nay."</p>

<p>General Forster laughed heartily,
not one whit offended at Betty's
"plain spakin'."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span></p>

<p>"Miss Gertrude Allston, as you
call her, will give me all the lines
you want, Betty; and she thought me
right enough to marry me. She is
my wife,&mdash;Mrs. Forster."</p>

<p>"An' is it so, sir?" said Betty,
dropping the rosy-cheeked apple she
was polishing, and gazing at the
gentleman with a mixture of curiosity
and admiration that was droll to
see. "Well, but ye're in luck; and
if it's Miss Gertrude that has the
managin' of ye, that's ka<i>rac</i>ter enough
of itself, an' I'll say take the child an'
my blessin' on all of yees. But when
she gets among yer fine folks, ye'll
not let her be forgettin' the woman
what cared for her when there was
none else to do it: will ye, sir? An'<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
ye'll be lettin' me see her once in a
while?"</p>

<p>There is no need to say that this was
readily promised, and the General
went on to tell Betty what plans he
and his wife had for Daisy. She was
to be taken for a while to his home,
where Mrs. Forster would provide her
with proper clothing; and then send
her to Miss Collins' boarding-school
to be taught and trained in a way to
satisfy her friends if they should ever
find her, or that she might one day
be able to earn her own living, if it
should be needful.</p>

<p>"An' I'm glad she should have the
bringin' up of a lady which is what
I couldn't give her," said Betty, with
another sigh, for it went to her heart<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
to part with her darling; "but ye'll
not be able to make her more of a
lady nor she is now; no, not if ye
dress her in gould and jewels, an' silks
an' satins. Niver a rough word nor
way has she with her, if she has been
with me and Jack more nor two year,
nor ye couldn't find a purtier behaved
child in all the land."</p>

<p>An hour or two later, Betty, having
found a friend to "mind" her
stall for her, guided General Forster
to the tiny house in the suburbs of
the city where she lived with Daisy
and Jack.</p>

<p>The two children were out in the
little garden gathering the flowers
which were to be tied up in bouquets
for Daisy's afternoon sale; and great<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
was their surprise, when the sound of
the gate-latch causing them to look
up, they saw Betty coming home at
this unusual hour of the day, and the
gentleman with her. Their business
was soon told; but although Daisy
flushed and smiled with astonishment
and delight when she heard what the
"gentleman who looked so like papa"
meant to do for her, the little face
soon shadowed over again, and she
shook her head gently but firmly
when she was asked if she would
go.</p>

<p>"An' why for no, dear?" asked
Betty. "Sure ye'd niver be for
throwin' away a chance the likes of
that, not to spake of it's bein' ongrateful
to the gintleman's kindness, an' he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
no more nor less than the husband of
Miss Gertrude."</p>

<p>But Daisy shook her head again;
and then first begging the gentleman's
pardon, as a polite little girl
should do, stepped up to her faithful
friend, and putting her arms about
her neck whispered something in her
ear.</p>

<p>The tears she had before with
trouble kept back now started to
Betty's eyes.</p>

<p>"Och, an' is it that, honey?" she
said in her broadest brogue, "an'
ye'll not let that be thrubblin' yer
dear heart. What a tinder, grateful
little sowl it is! Ye see, sir," she
went on, turning to the General, while
she smoothed with her loving hand<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
the little head which lay upon her
breast, "ye see, sir, it's just as I tellt
ye. She's a lady, every inch of her,
an' has feelin's that's jist oncommon.
An' there's a matter of back rint jew,
it's more'n a year, though me landlord
he's as good as gould, an' a bill
at the poticary's, an' little scores at
the baker's an' grocers what I niver
got paid off yet, not since the child
was sick an' I couldn't rightly make
things go; an' she says she won't be
lavin' us now that she can turn a
penny wid her posies an' help along."</p>

<p>Drawing the child to him, General
Forster whispered to her in his turn,
promising that the "back rint" and
other "scores" should be paid off
without delay if she would but come<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
with him; and Daisy, feeling herself
nearer home and friends than she had
ever done since the dreadful day of
the shipwreck, when she was parted
from "mamma," put her hand trustingly
in his to be led where he
would.</p>

<p>But the parting went hard. Daisy
could not leave those who had been
so kind, and shared their little all
with her, without many a bitter tear.
Betty kissed her and clung to her
and called down all heaven's blessings
on her head; and Jack hung
over the gate, uttering frantic howls
as he watched the sobbing child led
away by her new protector. Not
one thought gave Jack to his fourteen
years; not one to the "fellers from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
beyant the lot," who, drawn by his
cries, came flocking to see what ailed
him who was all their terror and
admiration: their admiration, because
he was bigger, stronger, braver than
any other boy of his age among their
crew; their terror, because of late he
allowed no bad word to be used in
his presence, banishing all who offended
in that way from their games,
choosing as his favorites and chief
companions those who were most
careful not to take God's name in
vain. So cursing and swearing had
come to be much less frequent than
of old among the lanes and lots lying
around the humble house where the
little Daisy had bloomed and grown
during the last two years, dropping<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
upon the path which God had chosen
for her good seed of which she knew
not herself.</p>

<p>Betty went back to her stand with
a heavy heart, knowing that when
she went home that night she should
miss the sweet little face which had
brightened and cheered her after many
a hard day's work; but she was half-consoled
for her own loss when she
saw Daisy coming down the street
holding General Forster's hand. For
the General's first care had been to
take the little girl to a place where
children's clothes could be had ready-made;
and where he had her fitted
out, as Betty said, "as nice as a new
pin and as became the little lady she
was by right."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span></p>

<p>But Daisy was as much a lady in
the coarse but clean calico frock and
patched shoes she had worn yesterday,
as she was now in the nice
clothes provided for her by General
Forster; for it was the sweet manners
and pretty ways she had never lost
which made her so, and the new garments
covered as warm and loving a
little heart as the old ones had done.
And so Betty found, and knew that
pride would have no place there,
when, as she reached the stand, Daisy
drew her hand from the gentleman's,
and running behind the stall as she
had many a time done when she was
eager to show Betty what a good
afternoon's sale she had made with
her flowers, threw her arms about<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
her neck and kissed her again and
again as lovingly as she had done
when she had no other friend in the
world.</p>

<p>Gentle Mrs. Forster gave Daisy a
warm welcome to her new home;
and the manner in which the child
fell at once into the ways and habits
of those about her plainly showed
that they were not new to her, but
that she had at some time been well
accustomed to a different life than
that she had led for the last two
years.</p>

<p>She had ways of her own, too, that
were very charming: a pretty, dainty
grace in her behavior and speech; a
thoughtfulness and care for others,
surprising in any child of her age,&mdash;for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
Daisy could not be more than
eight years old,&mdash;and particularly so
for one who had had little teaching for
some time. It was easy to see that
Daisy had received careful training
at one time, and that the lessons then
learned had taken deep root and were
not yet forgotten in spite of the long
separation from her home and friends.</p>

<p>It had been intended, as General
Forster told Betty, to send the little
girl to boarding-school at Miss Collins';
but she soon grew so closely
to the hearts of her new friends that
they felt as if they could not bear to
part with her; and it was at last settled
that her home was to be with
them for the present, at least, and
that she should only go to Miss Collins<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
for the morning, as most of the
other little girls in Glenwood did.</p>

<p>Mrs. Forster could not bear to send
from her this loving child, whose
greatest happiness seemed to be in
making others happy, and she grew
every day more and more interesting
as the familiar objects and customs
about her called up past recollections
of the home and parents she had lost.
She would watch the General for
hours at a time, as he sat reading or
writing, or follow him with wistful
eyes as he mounted his horse and
rode down the broad avenue "just
like papa;" would hang over the
lesser Daisy as she lay sleeping,
"'cause she looks just as our baby at
home used to," and delighted to wait<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
upon her and Mrs. Forster in a dainty,
neat-handed manner, which showed
that such loving service came quite
naturally to her.</p>

<p>She never called the infant "baby,"
as the rest of the family did. With
her it was always "little Daisy." She
seemed to love the pretty name, either
given to herself or another; and all
the variety of choice flowers with
which General Forster's garden was
filled could not win her chief affection
from her old favorite daisies,
"'cause mamma loved them so and
named me after them."</p>

<p>But though she remembered so
much, the child could not recall the
name of her parents, or where they
had lived. Their name "was not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
what Betty called it," she was sure;
but none the less had it passed from
her mind.</p>

<p>"Francine," the French bonne, used
to call mamma "Madame," and herself
"Mademoiselle Marguerite;" but
when she was asked what other people
used to call mamma and papa, the
little face grew clouded and pained
with the effort to remember; and
when name after name was mentioned
to her, she shook her head at
each one.</p>

<p>The General tried by every means
in his power to discover the friends
who must still be mourning the loss
of their sweet little daisy blossom,
but all in vain; and as week after
week went by, he and his wife decided<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
that they could not send her
forth from their own roof unless her
relations came to claim her. She
was an added ray of light where
all had been brightness and sunshine
before,&mdash;a lovely, precious little
flower, lending new fragrance
and beauty to the home where she
blossomed.</p>

<p>"I didn't mean to, Susy; 'pon my
word and honor I didn't; just as sure
as I'm alive."</p>

<p>Such were the words uttered by
two different little voices which our
Daisy heard, as holding by General
Forster's hand, she reached the gate
of Miss Collins' garden on the first
morning of her going to school in
Glenwood.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span></p>

<p>Now would it not have been
thought that some terrible misfortune
must have called forth that exclamation
from the first young speaker;
or that the second thought herself
accused of some dreadful crime, and
that she must prove her innocence at
once by all the strong words she
could think of, if she would escape
severe punishment?</p>

<p>And what was this mighty matter?</p>

<p>Why, just this.</p>

<p>Susy Edwards and several of her
schoolmates were "making a land of
Egypt." For of late the geography
lesson of the young class had been
upon that country, and they had been
much interested in the pictures of
the pyramids and Sphinx. And Susy,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
who "liked to make her knowledge
of use in her plays," and who was
considered by the other children to
have a great genius in that way, had
proposed that they should turn a portion
of their play-ground into Egypt.
This was thought a capital plan, and
the recess of the day before had been
employed in this way,&mdash;the little
planners and builders leaving it with
great regret, and returning to it before
school-time that morning with
fresh pleasure and some new ideas.</p>

<p>The gravel walk was supposed to
be the desert; the trough which led
the waste water from the spring, the
River Nile; while a jointed wooden
doll, cruelly deprived for the purpose
of all its limbs, had half of its remainder<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
buried in the gravel, to represent
the Sphinx. Any number of
pyramids, four or five inches high,
had been built out of pebbles, and
several were still going up.</p>

<p>And Lily Ward, the pet and darling
of the school, the youngest child,
and till that day the newest scholar
there, had brought that morning a
tiny doll's bath-tub, with a doll to
match lying in it, saying it was to be
"Moses in the bulrushes, for it couldn't
be a real land of Egypt without a
Moses."</p>

<p>Lily's idea was received with great
applause and admiration, and she felt
rather proud of it herself when she
heard it so much praised.</p>

<p>But a difficulty arose. The little<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
tub did duty for the ark of bulrushes
most beautifully, it was "so real and
so cunning;" and never was a meeker
baby than the one which lay so quietly
within it. But he must be hidden,
and nothing could be found to answer
for flags. The grass about the mock
River Nile was quite too short for that
purpose, trampled on as it was through
each day's playtime by at least twenty
pairs of little feet; and the willow
twigs which Lola Swan planted
would not stand up straight enough
to make a shade for the ark.</p>

<p>"There isn't time to plant them
deep enough," said Lola; "the school-bell
will ring in a few moments, and
then we'll have to leave it."</p>

<p>"And the sun will go and come<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
round here before recess," said Lily,
in a tone of distress, "and Moses will
be all sunburned. Besides, it isn't a
bit real: they never leave babies lying
out in the sun."</p>

<p>"Put him out on the grass and turn
the ark upside-down over him till we
come out again," said Susy.</p>

<p>But Lily scouted the idea of having
her Moses treated in this way; and
all began at once to deepen the holes
for the willow twigs before the bell
should ring.</p>

<p>But suddenly a bright thought
struck Lily.</p>

<p>"Let's play Moses' mother and
Miriam put a pyramid over him,"
she said. "We could do that pretty
quick, and it will be nice and shady<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
for him, and very real too, 'cause they
did have pyramids in Egypt."</p>

<p>All agreed readily, for this was
thought an excellent arrangement,
and they fell to work as fast as possible;
while Bessie Norton whispered
to Violet Swan, "What a smart child
Lily is, isn't she?"</p>

<p>"Yes," said Violet, in the same
tone, "very; and I expect when she is
grown up she will do something very
remarkable."</p>

<p>"What?" asked Susy Edwards,
who heard them.</p>

<p>"Be a genius, I expect," answered
Violet, solemnly.</p>

<p>"Oh, how nice!" said Bessie, who
had not the least idea what genius
meant, but did not like to say so.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span></p>

<p>The pyramid over the sleeping
Moses was nearly completed, the little
builders expecting each moment
to hear the bell, when Lola Swan,
coming with a fresh supply of pebbles,
tripped over a stick which lay
upon the grass, and, trying to recover
herself, let her load fall around and
upon the half-built pyramid, knocking
down half a dozen or so of the
stones which composed it. Not
much harm was done, but Susy
immediately exclaimed,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Goodness gracious! mercy me!"
and Lola answered as you have heard
in the words which met Daisy's ear
as she and General Forster entered
the garden.</p>

<p>The click of the gate-latch caused<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
all the children to look up, and Moses
and the pyramids were for the moment
forgotten at the sight of the
new scholar.</p>

<p>"Why! there's Daisy Forster," said
Lily, for Daisy was now known by
this name.</p>

<p>"I wonder if she's coming here to
school," said another; and that question
was speedily answered, as, stopping
by the little group, the General,
whom all knew and liked, said,
"Here's a new schoolmate for you.
Will you be kind to her, and make
her feel at home?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir, we will; and I'll take
care of her," said Lily, scrambling to
her feet and taking Daisy's hand in a
patronizing manner. "She won't feel<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
much strange after one day, 'cause
we'll all be good to her, and she shall
help us make our land of Egypt."</p>

<p>"Ah! that is what you are doing,
is it?" said the General.</p>

<p>"Yes, sir," answered Lily; "we're
just putting a pyramid over Moses in
the bulrushes, 'cause we hav'n't time
to fix so many bulrushes till recess.
And part of it is knocked down.
Lola did it, but she didn't mean to,
and if you peep in there between
those stones you can see a little bit
of the ark and Moses' dear little
china arm poking up. Please to
peek, sir."</p>

<p>The General did as he was requested,
saying that he saw Moses
quite plainly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span></p>

<p>"It isn't much matter if we do
have to leave him now," said Lily;
"he's pretty nicely covered up."</p>

<p>"I think so," said the General,
gravely; "and if I were Moses, with
a pyramid being built over me, I
think I should prefer to have a small
breathing-hole left."</p>

<p>"Why, so he would," said Lily;
"and now we can leave him nicely
fixed, and play he's very comfortable
in his pyramid, even if it's not quite
done."</p>

<p>Lily being satisfied with the fate of
Moses, all the rest were so; and the
bell now ringing, the little group
turned towards the house. Daisy
wondering, as well she might, that a
matter which was so easily settled<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
should call for such violent expressions
of distress and alarm as she
had heard from two of the little
girls.</p>

<p>"Why, Miss Collins," said General
Forster, as that lady met them at the
door, "what a bouquet of flowers you
have here! A Rose, a Violet, a
Daisy, and a Lily; as choice a nosegay
as one could wish for."</p>

<p>"And the Lily is going to take care
of the Daisy, and make her feel to
home, Miss Collins," said Lily, who
still held Daisy's hand. "The General
said I could."</p>

<p>"No, he didn't," said Susy.</p>

<p>"Yes, he <i>did</i>, 'pon my word he
did; least I said I would do it, and
he didn't say I couldn't: did you,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
sir?" said Lily, throwing back her
head to look up at the General's tall
figure.</p>

<p>"And that comes to the same thing,
does it, Lily?" he said, laughing;
"well, I suppose it does; and I promise
you shall look after Daisy till she feels
no longer a stranger among you."</p>

<p>"She knows me, and Loly and Violet,
as well as any thing," said Lily;
for the little girls had met several
times before, and Lily felt herself and
the two Swans to be on rather intimate
terms with Daisy Forster.</p>

<p>"All right, then. I leave her to
you. Good-morning, Miss Collins,"
and with a bow to the lady, with whom
he had before made all the necessary
arrangements for Daisy, a pleasant<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
nod for the little ones, and a kiss for
Daisy, he went away.</p>

<p>Daisy felt rather lonely when he
was gone, in spite of Miss Collins'
kind look, Lily's tight clasp of the
hand, and Violet's, "We have real
nice times in school. Don't be afraid."
For she was far more shy with children
than she was with grown people,
probably because she had never had
any companions of her own age; and
the number of young faces, most of
them strange, about her, made her
long to be back again at Mrs. Forster's
side. And they all looked at
her a good deal, for her story was well
known among them, and she was an
object of great curiosity.</p>

<p>Lily observed this, as she took her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
seat with Daisy beside her, and
thought she must speak up for her
charge.</p>

<p>"Miss Collins," she said, "please to
make a rule."</p>

<p>"Well," said Miss Collins, smiling;
for Lily was constantly asking for
new rules concerning things which
did not suit her. She had begun with
this more than a year ago when she
was only a visitor at the school; and
she was even now not a regular scholar,
but only coming for a few weeks.
For her papa and mamma had gone
on a journey, and Lily, being lonely
at home when Ella and the boys were
at school, it had been arranged that
she was to go with Ella in the morning.
So she was rather a privileged<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
person, and spoke her mind freely
concerning that which did not please
her, which the other children thought
rather a joke, and were generally
ready enough to fall in with Lily's
rules. So now they all listened.</p>

<p>"Please to make a rule that nobody
must stare, ma'am," said Lily: "it
makes people feel so to be stared at,"&mdash;and
Lily put up both hands to her
cheeks,&mdash;"specially if they are new."</p>

<p>"Very true," answered Miss Collins:
"let us all try to remember the
Golden Rule, and then we shall
neither stare nor do any thing else
to hurt another's feelings."</p>

<p>Then she struck the little bell which
stood upon her table, and all knew
the school had begun, and they must
be quiet.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span></p>

<p>Next calling Bessie Norton to her,
Miss Collins gave her a number of
Bibles, and the little girl handed one
to each of her classmates. Then
Miss Collins read a verse aloud, and
the children followed, each in her
turn.</p>

<p>"Minnie Grey may take the Bibles,"
said Miss Collins when this was done.</p>

<p>Minnie rose, and went from one
to another collecting the Bibles. But
instead of taking as many as she
could conveniently carry at one time,
giving them to Miss Collins, and coming
back for the rest, she went on
piling one on top of another, till one
arm was quite full, when she came to
Daisy and held out her other hand for
her book. As she did so, the top one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
of the pile fell to the floor. Minnie
stooped for it, and down went two or
three more.</p>

<p>"Oh! bother the old things," said
Minnie, in a low voice, but very impatiently.</p>

<p>Daisy had stooped to help her pick
up the Bibles, but the glow her cheeks
wore when she raised her head again
was not all owing to that.</p>

<p>Bother the old things! What old
things? Why, the Bibles, God's own
Holy Word.</p>

<p>Daisy was very much shocked, and
she looked up at Miss Collins, expecting
to hear her reprove such <i>wicked
words</i>, <i>she</i> thought them.</p>

<p>But Miss Collins had not heard
Minnie's exclamation, though the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
noise of the falling books had called
her attention that way, and she said,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Minnie, my dear, you are careless
with those Bibles: do you forget
whose books they are?"</p>

<p>"I don't care," muttered Minnie,
but not so that the lady could hear.
Daisy heard again; and the thought
passed through her mind, "What a
wicked little girl Minnie must be!"</p>

<p>And yet Daisy was mistaken. If
she had asked Minnie's parents,
teacher, or playmates, they would all
have told her that Minnie was an uncommonly
good and pleasant little
girl; truthful, obedient, industrious,
and generous and obliging towards
others. She had no thought now that
she was breaking one of God's commandments;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
and she would have been
both offended and grieved, if she had
known what was in Daisy's mind,
believing herself, as she did, to be innocent
of any wrong.</p>

<h2>V.<br />

<small>DAISY AT STUDY.</small></h2>


<div class='drop-cap'>DAISY was soon at home with her
schoolmates, and a great favorite
among them.</div>

<p>It was not strange that they liked
and were interested in her. She was
such a gentle, modest, amiable little
girl; watching and joining in the
games and lessons of the others with
a kind of innocent wonder which
amused and touched them all. For
Daisy was not at all accustomed to be
with children of her own age, and
their ways were all new to her.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span></p>

<p>And of course she was behind all
the rest in her studies. She could
not even read as well as Lily Ward;
and had to begin with the simplest
lessons, such as Lily and two or three
of the very youngest children learned.
At first this troubled her, and she
feared the rest of the class would
laugh at her.</p>

<p>But she soon found she need not
have been afraid of that, for the rule
of Miss Collins' infant class was the
law of kindness; and any one of the
little girls would have thought it
almost a crime to laugh or mock at
Daisy, for that which was her misfortune
and not her fault.</p>

<p>They might now and then fall out
a little among themselves, for they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
were by no means perfect children;
sometimes there would be some selfishness
shown, or even a few angry
words pass from one to another; but,
on the whole, they agreed about as
well as any twenty little girls could
be expected to do; and not one
among them would have had the
heart purposely to do an unkind thing
to another. Least of all to Daisy
Forster, whom they all looked upon
with a kind of tender pity and interest,
because of her sad and romantic
history; and who was at once taken
up by both teacher and scholars as
a sort of twin pet with Lily, for
whom allowances were to be made,
and who was to be encouraged and
aided as much as possible.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span></p>

<p>So Daisy found plenty of helpers,
who, so far from laughing at her mistakes
and backwardness, were rather
inclined to think her quick and industrious,
as indeed she was, trying hard
to make up for lost time, and "catch
up" with those of her own age.</p>

<p>She was almost too eager about
this, and had to be checked now and
then, for since the long illness which
had followed the shipwreck, Daisy
had never been strong; and too much
fatigue or study, or even too much
play, would make her nervous and
sick, and her little head would become
confused and ache. So now
and then Mrs. Forster would have
to take the books from her, and forbid
more study, sending her out to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
play, or to work in the plot of ground
which had been given her for a garden
of her own.</p>

<p>She was not always pleased at this,
and sometimes would be rather fretful
and impatient. But Mrs. Forster
soon found a way to put a stop to
this.</p>

<p>One afternoon she found the little
girl bending over her slate with
flushed and heated cheeks, anxious
eyes, and trembling hands.</p>

<p>"Daisy," she said, quietly, "what
are you doing? Miss Collins has
not given you lessons out of school,
has she?"</p>

<p>"No, ma'am," said Daisy; "but
I asked Ella Ward to set me a whole
lot of sums so that I could do them<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
at home, and I can't make this one
come right. I know it is not right,
'cause Ella put the answers on the
other side of the slate, and mine
won't come the same, all I can do."</p>

<p>Mrs. Forster took the slate from
her hand.</p>

<p>"This sum is too hard for you,
Daisy," she said: "you do not know
enough arithmetic for this."</p>

<p>"It is not any harder than the sums
Lola and Violet and the other girls
as large as I am do," answered Daisy,
looking ready to burst out crying;
"and I have to do arithmetic with
the very little ones, like Lily, and it
makes me ashamed; so I want to go
on all I can. <i>Please</i> give me the
slate again, Aunt Gertrude," she added,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
as Mrs. Forster laid it beyond her
reach.</p>

<p>"No, dear. I do not wish you to
study out of school. I am glad you
want to improve, but you have as
much to do there as is good for you;
and at home I want you to have rest
and play. You are improving quite
as fast as could be expected, and for
a time you must be content to go on
with those who are younger than
yourself."</p>

<p>"But it makes me ashamed," pleaded
Daisy, again.</p>

<p>"There is no reason for that," said
Mrs. Forster, patting the hot cheek
she raised towards her. "The other
children do not laugh at you and
make you uncomfortable, do they?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh, no, ma'am," said Daisy; "they
are all so good to me, and when they
can't help seeing what a dunce I am"
(here Daisy's tears overflowed), "they
always say kind things about how I
never went to school before, and how
my own dear mamma was drowned,
and there was nobody to teach me
till I came to you."</p>

<p>"You are not a dunce, dear," said
the lady. "A child who idles away
her time when she should be studying,
and does not care whether or no
she learns as much as is fit for her,
is a dunce: not a little girl who really
wishes to be industrious, but does not
know quite as much as others of her
own age only because God has not
given her the same advantages in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
time past. No one will think my
Daisy a dunce. Now, we must have
no more studying at home, no more
lessons than those Miss Collins sets
you."</p>

<p>Daisy did not look satisfied: on
the contrary, she even pouted a little.</p>

<p>"Daisy," said Mrs. Forster, "suppose
Uncle Frank were to give you
some beautiful and costly thing
which would be of great use to you
in time to come if you took good care
of it, say a watch: what would you
do with it?"</p>

<p>"Why! I <i>would</i> take great care,
oh! such care of it," said Daisy, opening
her eyes in some surprise at the
question. She did not see what that
could have to do with her studies.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span></p>

<p>"I'd wind it up every night, and
try to keep it right and safe every
way I could. But I don't know if I
am quite large enough to have a
watch of my own, or take care of it;
maybe the best way would be to ask
you or Uncle Frank to keep it for
me till I was older."</p>

<p>"And suppose for a while he gave
you no key to this watch, but let it
run down and be quiet?"</p>

<p>"I'd just put it away till he gave
me a key, and be patient about it,"
said Daisy, wondering more and
more.</p>

<p>"And if, by and by, when he gave
you this key, you should go on winding
and winding the watch farther and
faster than it was right for it to go,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
till the wheels and springs were all
spoiled and out of order, would Uncle
Frank think you cared much for his
gift?"</p>

<p>"Why, no, Aunt Gertrude; and he
wouldn't think I cared much for him,
either, to use his pretty present so."</p>

<p>"You are right, dear. And now
I want my own little Daisy to see
how it is with herself. God has
given to you a young mind, bright
and quick enough; but, for a while,
He did not choose that it should do
much work. But now He has given
you the key by which you may wind
it and set it to work; and if you use
it without proper care, and so as to
hurt and wear out this precious gift,
would it not seem as if you cared<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
very little about it, and did not respect
and honor the Giver?"</p>

<p>"Yes'm," answered Daisy, beginning
to see what Mrs. Forster meant;
"but I never thought about that."</p>

<p>"I believe I never thought about
it before, dear," said Mrs. Forster,
smiling. "I am not afraid to praise
you, Daisy; and I may safely say that
I have never seen any little child who
showed such true honor and reverence
for her Maker, and all which belongs
to Him. You must have been
well taught, my child; and to know
and remember such lessons is worth
all the book learning in the world."</p>

<p>Daisy was pleased, as she always
was when any one spoke to her of
her long-lost home, or praised the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
teaching she had received from those
who had loved and cared for her
there. And from this time there was
no further trouble about the lessons;
for it was enough for Daisy to know
that she was misusing any one of
God's good gifts, to make her change
her ways. Many a lesson might
have been learned, and, indeed, had
been learned, by those older and wiser
than herself, from the loving care and
respect paid by this little one to her
Creator's name, and to all the works
of His hand.</p>

<p>And it was a great trouble to her to
hear the careless way in which many
of her schoolmates used sacred names
and things. They did not mean any
harm; they did not think it any sin;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
but every day Daisy was shocked
and distressed by hearing such words
as "mercy," "gracious," "goodness,"
and "good heavens," and the like,
from the lips of the other children, as
they were about their play and study.
It had become a habit with nearly all in
the school; one caught it from another
almost without knowing it; even
Lily Ward, who once thought the
clergyman "preached a sermon at
her" because she said "hush up,"
now and then followed the example
of the others when any thing vexed
or surprised her. A few weeks at
school had accustomed Lily to the
constant use of expressions which a
year ago she would have considered
"real naughty words."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span></p>

<p>The older girls in Miss Sarah Collins'
room had fallen into this bad
habit as much, if not more, than the
little ones of the infant class.</p>

<p>And it was not only this carelessness
of speech in which they were all,
large and small, to blame; but it
seemed to Daisy so strange that they
could handle and treat the Bible,
God's holy Word, with so little reverence
and respect, knocking it about
among their other books as if it were
no better than these last, even using
it, sometimes, for purposes to which
no book, even the most common one,
should be put.</p>

<p>Daisy wondered that Miss Collins
did not teach them better; but either
she did not notice all this, or she did not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
think it of much consequence; certain
it is that she did not check them,
and the evil seemed to Daisy to grow
worse from day to day.</p>

<p>At first she did not like to speak
herself. You may wonder that this
was so, since she had not feared to
speak so plainly to General Forster,
who was a grown gentleman, so much
older than herself; but she had done
that almost without knowing what she
was saying, for, as you know, his profane
words had startled her so that he
was surprised, and he had almost
forced her to tell him what had disturbed
her.</p>

<p>And here she was with every thing
strange around her, school, schoolmates,
and teacher all new to her; so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
it is not astonishing that she was
rather shy and felt afraid to interfere
with the others, or to tell them that
she thought they were doing wrong.</p>

<p>But by and by there came a day
when she could no longer hold her
peace.</p>

<h2>VI.<br />

<small>DAISY A TEACHER.</small></h2>


<div class='drop-cap'>ONE morning just after school
commenced, a heavy shower
came up; and when it was time for
the recess, which was always given to
the infant class at eleven o'clock, the
ground was still so wet that the little
ones were forced to find amusement
within doors or upon the piazza.</div>

<p>"What shall we play?" asked
Rosie Pierson.</p>

<p>"Lady Queen Fair," said Bessie
Norton: "we'll go out on the piazza
and play it."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 348px;">
<img src="images/i-133.jpg" width="348" height="471" alt="Girl on chair other girls around her" />
</div>

<p>"Yes," said Violet; "and Lily
shall be Lady Queen Fair, and we'll
dress her up a little. Miss Emily,"
as a third Miss Collins, who gave
music lessons to the girls, passed by,
"may we have a rose to put in Lily's
hair for Lady Fair?"</p>

<p>The young lady smiled, stopped
and pulled a couple of roses from the
vine which wound itself around one
of the pillars of the piazza, and gave
them to Violet, then passed on.</p>

<p>Time had been when Violet would
have hoped, perhaps would have asked
to be Lady Fair herself, and been
sulky and displeased if the other
children had not agreed; but now she
was very different, and more apt to
prefer another before herself.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span></p>

<p>The roses were soon arranged, the
one in the hair, the other in the bosom
of the little Lady Queen, who took
her dignities in the calmest manner.
Meanwhile some of the other children
were drawing forward one of the rustic
chairs with which the piazza was
furnished, to serve as a throne.</p>

<p>But the little queen, like many
another royal lady before her, found
her throne by no means an easy
one.</p>

<p>"Ow!" she said, rubbing her little
round white shoulders where she had
scratched them against the rough bark
of the twisted boughs which made the
back of the chair, "ow! this is not
nice at all, or comfortal. My feet
don't come to the floor, and if I lean<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
back I'm all scratched. I'd rather be
a queen without a throne."</p>

<p>"Oh, no! You must have a throne,"
said Susy Edwards. "Queens have
to."</p>

<p>"I don't see why," said Lily, rather
pettishly; for she did not feel very
well that morning, and that and the
close heat of the day made her more
fretful than usual. "I should think
queens could do just as they have a
mind to and make their subjiks do it
too; and I don't see what they have
to have their skin all scraped up for
if they don't want to;" and Lily
twisted her head to give an aggrieved
look at the little fat shoulder with that
red mark upon it.</p>

<p>"I'll fix you," said Lola. "I'll put<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
Miss Collins' footstool under your
feet and you shall have the big cushion
behind you. Some one bring the
cushion while I carry the stool."</p>

<p>The footstool was brought in a
moment; but the cushion was not to
be found.</p>

<p>"The big girls had it yesterday,"
said Fanny Satterlee. "I saw them
with it in their recess when I was
going home. There comes Cora
Prime now; let's ask her. Cora,
what did the big girls do with that
cushion yesterday when they had done
with it?"</p>

<p>"The Lord knows; I don't," said
Cora, playfully tapping Fanny on the
head with the roll of music in her
hand.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh!" exclaimed Lily.</p>

<p>Daisy did not speak; but as Cora's
eye happened to fall upon her, her
face said as much as Lily's "Oh!"</p>

<p>"What's the matter with you two?"
asked Cora, looking from one to the
other of the little girls, but still good-natured.</p>

<p>"You oughtn't to say that," said
Lily.</p>

<p>"Ought not to say what?"</p>

<p>"The Lord knows," answered Lily.</p>

<p>"Well, don't He know?" asked
Cora.</p>

<p>"No," said Lily, doubtfully, "I guess
not. I don't believe He'd bother
Himself with knowing about a worn-out
old cushion what has a hole in
the cover, and such things."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span></p>

<p>"Yes, He does, too," said Cora,
laughing; "are not the very hairs of
our head numbered?"</p>

<p>"Now, I <i>know</i> you ought to be
'shamed," said Lily. "You're talking
Bible; and that is not right, is it,
Daisy?"</p>

<p>"No," said Daisy, as boldly as Lily
herself could have done, for quoting
Scripture in a careless manner was
also a habit of many in the school.</p>

<p>"You two saucy monkeys! correcting
your elders," said Cora, much
amused. "I heard you both talking
Bible to Miss Collins this morning
with all the rest of your class."</p>

<p>"We were only saying what we
learned in Sunday school yesterday,"
said Lily. "That's not the same<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
thing. I <i>know</i> it's not right to talk
Bible that kind of a way. Papa says
so, and he tells us not to do it."</p>

<p>"Your papa's saying so does not
make a thing right or wrong," said
Cora.</p>

<p>"Yes, it does, too!" said Lily.
"My papa knows a whole lot, and he
wouldn't tell a story for any thing.
Cora, you'd better go to your music
lesson: I 'speck Miss Emily wants
you."</p>

<p>"Oh, you are very considerate for
Miss Emily, all at once," said Cora,
more amused than ever; "but you
haven't told me why I shouldn't say,
The Lord knows, when He does
know."</p>

<p>Lily looked at Daisy, who stood<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
by the arm of her chair, for help.
The little one felt that Cora was
wrong, but she did not exactly know
how to answer, and she had noticed
how careful Daisy was to honor the
name of God.</p>

<p>"Is it not taking the name of God
in vain?" said Daisy.</p>

<p>"Upon my word!" said Cora.
"Do you mean to call that swearing?"</p>

<p>"Well, yes," said Lily, taking up
the word, "a kind of baby swearing,
I s'pose; but you know it's not very
good of you, Cora."</p>

<p>"Everybody says such things: they
don't mean any thing," said Cora.</p>

<p>"Not <i>everybody</i>," answered Lily.
"Daisy don't."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span></p>

<p>"Then Daisy's uncommonly good,"
said Cora.</p>

<p>"Yes, she is," replied Lily; "and
I s'pose <i>everybody</i> ought to be uncommonly
good and never say them."</p>

<p>Cora laughed again.</p>

<p>"Everybody must mind their p's
and q's before you: mustn't they,
Lily?" and away she ran to her music
lesson.</p>

<p>"Here's the cushion," said Rosie
Pierson, running out from the school-room.
"I found it in the closet under
the shelf where those careless big girls
left it, I s'pose."</p>

<p>The cushion was put behind Lily's
shoulders, but still the little queen
fidgeted on her throne and declared
she was not yet "comfortal."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span></p>

<p>"'Cause if I lean back against the
cushion my feet won't touch the stool,"
she said.</p>

<p>"We'll put something else on the
stool to make it higher," said Nettie
Prime, who was trying to arrange
Lily satisfactorily: "what shall we
take? Oh, I know. Daisy, run
and bring the big Bible off Miss
Collins' table for Lily to put her feet
on."</p>

<p>Daisy, who made a motion to start
forward as Nettie began to speak,
stood still when she heard what she
called for.</p>

<p>"Make haste," said the latter, impatiently:
"we won't have a bit of
time to play."</p>

<p>Daisy did not move, but stood with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
rising color, trying to make up her
mind to speak.</p>

<p>"Oh! you disobliging thing!" said
Violet, and she ran for the book.</p>

<p>"Oh! don't," said Daisy, as Violet
came back and stooped to put the
Bible on the footstool; "I didn't mean
to be disobliging, but we ought not to
use the Bible to play with."</p>

<p>"Pooh!" said Violet: "Lily's little
feet won't hurt it. It's all worn out,
any way. The cover is real shabby."</p>

<p>"I didn't mean that," answered
Daisy; "I meant because it is God's
book, and we ought to treat it very
carefully."</p>

<p>"Oh, fiddle! How awfully particular
you are, Daisy!" said Minnie Grey.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
"Why, girls, do you know, the other
day, when I was playing paper-dolls
with her and I turned up a Bible to
make the side of a house, she took it
away, and when I put it back again
'cause it stood up better than the other
books, she said she wouldn't play if I
did so with the Bible."</p>

<p>"I s'pose Daisy would call that
'taking God's name in vain,'" said
another, half reproachfully; "wouldn't
you, Daisy?"</p>

<p>"I think it is something the same,"
answered Daisy, feeling as if all the
others were finding fault with her and
thinking her "awfully particular," a
crime which no little girl likes to have
laid to her charge.</p>

<p>"I don't see how," said Lola. "I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
know we ought not to play with the
Bible; but I don't see how it is taking
God's name in vain."</p>

<p>"But the Bible is God's book, and
He told it to the men who wrote it, and
His name is in it a great many times,"
said Daisy, "and I think it seems like
taking it in vain to play with it or to
put things upon it, or to knock it about
like our other school-books. And it is
not right to say 'the Lord knows,' and
'mercy,' and 'gracious,' and such
words, when we are just playing, or
when we are provoked."</p>

<p>"What is the harm?" asked Rosie.
"Mercy and gracious are not God's
name."</p>

<p>"Well, no," said Daisy, slowly, not
exactly knowing how to explain herself.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
"And maybe I make a mistake;
but it does seem to me as if it was a
kind of&mdash;of&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Of little swearing, as Lily says,"
said Lola.</p>

<p>"Yes," said Daisy. "Rosie thinks
it is no harm; but even if it is not
much harm, I don't see what is the
good of it. We can talk just as well
without saying such words."</p>

<p>"I guess they are pretty wicked,"
said Lily. "The day mamma went
away, I said 'good heavens,' and she
said 'Lily! Lily!' very quick, like
she does when I do something very
naughty, and she asked me where I
learned that; and I told her Elly said
it. I didn't mean to tell a tale about
Elly; but mamma looked sorry, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
she told me never to say it again. I
guess 'mercy' is 'most the same, and
I guess I won't say it any more; and,
Daisy, if I hear the other girls say
those words, I'll help you correct
'em."</p>

<p>Lily promised this with an air of
such grave importance that the other
children laughed. Not in the least
abashed, Lily went on,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Papa's coming home day after to-morrow,
and I'll ask him to tell me a
whole lot about God's name, and why
it is wrong to say those things; and
then I'll tell all you girls. But I'm
not coming to school any more when
mamma comes home; so you'll have
to come to my house, and I'll have a
swearing class, and teach you all about
it."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span></p>

<p>Lily's words might have been taken
with a different meaning from that
which she intended to give them; but
the other children understood her, and
that was enough.</p>

<p>"But, Daisy," said Lola, "how do
you know so much about these things
when you don't know a great deal
about every-day lessons, and have
had no one to teach you for so
long?"</p>

<p>"I don't know," said Daisy. "I
think my own mamma who was
drowned used to teach me in the
home I used to have;" and the dreamy
look came into her eyes which they
always wore when she spoke of her
far-away home and those she had
loved there. "I think I've forgotten<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
a good many things," she added;
"but you know I couldn't forget what
mamma taught me about Jesus and
what He wanted us to do if we loved
Him. And I think if we do love
Him we won't say words about His
name, His heaven, or any thing that is
His, that are not very good and gentle,
and that we are very sure He would
like us to say."</p>

<p>"But you are so <i>very</i> particular,
Daisy," said Minnie; "I think you
are most <i>too</i> particular."</p>

<p>"I didn't think we could be too
particular about doing what Jesus
likes," said Daisy.</p>

<p>The other children had all gathered
about Daisy, and were listening
with interest to what she said. Perhaps<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
they heard her with more patience
than they would have given to
any one else; for Daisy was a kind of
mystery to them, and they looked
upon her as a sort of fairy or princess
in disguise, and would not have been
at all surprised to hear the most extravagant
stories about her, for she
was "just like a story-book child."
Lily had said so one day when she
was speaking of her at home.</p>

<p>"No," said Lola, thoughtfully; "but
it does not seem as if such little things
could be wrong. I know it can't be
right to play with the Bible or say its
words just when we are joking or for
our own common talk; but I don't see
the harm of saying 'goodness,' or
'mercy,' or 'heavens,' or those words<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
which you never will say, Daisy; they
are not God's name, and I don't see
how it is taking it in vain to say
them."</p>

<p>Daisy looked thoughtful. She felt
she was right, and wanted to explain
herself; but she was rather shy and
could not find words to do so.</p>

<p>But Lily, whom shyness never
troubled, came to her aid.</p>

<p>"Never mind," she said: "I'll ask
papa just as soon as he comes home,
and he'll tell us all about it; and if
he says it is naughty, why, it is, and
we won't do it; and if he says it's
good enough, why, we will. That's
the way to fix it."</p>

<p>Here the bell rang.</p>

<p>"There, now," said Susy Edwards,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
"we have to go in, and we've wasted all
our time talking, and never had a bit
of good of our recess."</p>

<p>But I think Susy was mistaken,
and that they had one and all gained
more good from their talk than they
could have done from any amount of
play; for it had set more than one
young mind thinking; and from this
day, even the most careless among
them would check herself when she
found she was on the point of using
these words which had grown so common
among them, more from want of
thought than from any wish or temptation
to do wrong.</p>

<h2>VII.<br />

<small>THE SWEARING CLASS.</small></h2>


<div class='drop-cap'>WHEN Lily's papa and mamma
came home, she was so glad to
see them, and there was so much to
hear and to talk about, that she quite
forgot her purpose of asking her father
to teach her about the third commandment.
Besides, she no longer went
to school now that her mother was at
home, but had her lesson each day
with her as she had done before Mrs.
Ward went on her journey; and so she
was not as apt to hear or to say those<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
careless words which Daisy Forster
had said it was not right to use.</div>

<p>But it was at last brought to her
mind one evening as the family all sat
at the tea-table.</p>

<p>"Mamma," said Ella, "will you let
Lily and me have a tea-party to-morrow?
I want to ask half a dozen of
our girls, and I suppose Lily would
like to have a few of the little ones at
the same time."</p>

<p>"Yes," answered Mrs. Ward, "you
may each ask six of your most intimate
friends."</p>

<p>"Can Walter and I ask some of the
fellows?" said Ned.</p>

<p>"Oh, mercy! no," said Ella: "we
don't want any boys. It is not to be a
regular party, Ned. I just want the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
girls to spend the afternoon and drink
tea; and it makes more fuss to have
boys too."</p>

<p>"Goodness me! You needn't get
into such a way about it," said Ned.</p>

<p>"Children," said Lily, her brother's
and sister's words bringing back to
her what Daisy had said, "children,
you needn't either of you swear about
it."</p>

<p>Lily's efforts to keep the family
straight were generally considered as
a good joke, and her reproofs and
advice received with a laugh; but
this plain speaking was rather <i>too</i>
much for either Ella or Ned, and the
former exclaimed,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Well, who is swearing, I'd like to
know?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span></p>

<p>"And who gave you leave to correct
your elders?" said Ned.</p>

<p>"Nobody: I just took it," said unabashed
Lily; and then, turning to her
father, she exclaimed, "Papa, I b'lieve
the girls in our school are pretty heathen,
and don't know enough about
the comman'ments. So I told them
we'd have a swearing class, and I'd ask
you to teach it, 'cause I s'pose you
know a good deal about swearing;
and this will be a good chance when
they come to-morrow."</p>

<p>This speech turned the vexation of
Ella and Ned into amusement, and
they laughed with the others.</p>

<p>"I don't think your playmates will
thank you for asking them here to take
tea and then bringing them up for a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
lecture from me, my pet," said Mr.
Ward.</p>

<p>"Yes: they will, papa. They want
to know about it, and I think we'd
better make a swearing party of this.
I b'lieve it would do those big girls
good too. They swear, oh, dreadfully!
and they don't seem to think they do,
least Cora don't. Mamma, let's make
a rule we won't have any swearing in
this house: won't you?"</p>

<p>"Certainly," said mamma, smiling;
"and I think we must find out what
<i>swearing</i> is, and be careful not to break
the rule."</p>

<p>"If one is going to call 'goodness'
and 'mercy,' and such things, swearing,
one might as well give up talking
altogether," said Ella.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span></p>

<p>"Perhaps not exactly swearing,"
said her father; "but the use of them
is a bad habit, and one that I have
noticed is quite too frequent among
all the young people of this place.
It is growing stronger too, as all
such habits do, and going from bad
to worse. But I must go out now,
and have not time to talk to you about
it. If Lily can persuade her little
friends to take the 'swearing class,'
as part of their afternoon's entertainment
to-morrow, well and good; if
not, we will have a little private talk
among ourselves some other time."</p>

<p>Ella was not at all pleased by Lily's
proposal; and hoping that it would
pass from the child's mind before the
afternoon, she was careful not to make<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
her remember it by the use of any
such words as had called forth Lily's
reproof.</p>

<p>This had very nearly proved successful;
and in the excitement of arranging
her baby-house, setting out
the new tea-set mamma had brought
her, and dressing the doll which had
been papa's present, Lily had almost
forgotten her plan for mingling wholesome
instruction with the amusement
provided for her young friends.</p>

<p>There were Lola and Violet Swan,
Daisy Forster, Rosie Pierson, Minnie
Grey, and Bessie Norton; and they
were all having a real good time sitting
around a small table and playing
tea out of the new china set, when
Minnie said,&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span></p>

<p>"I have a secret to tell all of you,
if you'll promise never to tell."</p>

<p>"I won't," said Violet.</p>

<p>"On your sacred word and honor?"
said Minnie.</p>

<p>"On my sacred word and honor,"
repeated Violet.</p>

<p>"And you, Rosie?" asked Minnie.</p>

<p>"On my word and honor," said
Rosie.</p>

<p>"Sacred?" said Minnie.</p>

<p>"Sacred. Sacred word and honor,"
was Rosie's answer.</p>

<p>Lily repeated the words as desired,
and next came Daisy's turn.</p>

<p>"I won't tell," she said, when Minnie
looked at her.</p>

<p>"On your sacred word and honor?"
asked Minnie.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span></p>

<p>"I promise I won't tell, Minnie."</p>

<p>"But you must say on your word
and honor."</p>

<p>"I can't," said Daisy.</p>

<p>"Then I shan't tell you; and you're
real mean, Daisy Forster," said Minnie.
"Why won't you say so?"</p>

<p>"I don't see why I need, and I
don't know if it is quite right," answered
Daisy, coloring.</p>

<p>"Oh, Daisy Forster, what a girl
you are!" said Rosie.</p>

<p>"Well," said Lily, "there's nothing
left, 'cept these two caramels.
Daisy, you eat up this; and, Bessie,
you eat up the other. Now the tea-party
is all done, and we'll go and
ask papa about that comman'ment.
He's been playing croquet with the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
big girls, but they seem to be resting
now."</p>

<p>Lily was right. Mr. Ward had
been persuaded to make the eighth
in a game of croquet, for he was a
great favorite with all the young
people in Glenwood, and his presence
never put any check upon their games
or pleasure parties.</p>

<p>But the afternoon proved rather
warm for exercise, even the gentle
one of bewitching croquet; and, after
a long game was finished, the whole
party were ready to agree to Ella's
proposal that they should take a rest,
and send to the house for some cooling
drink.</p>

<p>So Mr. Ward was at liberty to attend
to Lily, when she came rushing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
up to him, followed, rather more
slowly, by the rest of the children.</p>

<p>"Papa," she said, throwing herself
across his knee, as he sat upon the
green mound which was raised about
the foot of one of the fine elm-trees
which shaded the croquet-ground,
"papa, Daisy says we oughtn't to say
upon our words and honors! Oughtn't
we? And will you teach us about
taking God's name in vain now? It's
the <i>singalest</i> circumstance, but I went
and forgot all about the swearing
class, till Daisy said that."</p>

<p>"A very singular circumstance,
certainly;" said Mr. Ward, lifting
Lily to a seat upon his knee, and
smiling, while the other girls laughed
at her speech. "I am quite willing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
to have a little talk with you all on
this subject; but tell me first what
you want to know."</p>

<p>"Daisy is so awfully particular,
Mr. Ward," said Minnie, in an aggrieved
tone. "She won't let us say
any thing; at least, she says every
thing is 'wrong.'"</p>

<p>"Every thing?" said Mr. Ward:
"that is bad. Does Daisy want you
all to keep silence? That <i>must</i> spoil
your play."</p>

<p>"Oh, no!" said Minnie, "not that;
but she says such lots of things are
wrong to say. Why, sir, she won't
say 'upon her word and honor,' 'cause
she don't think it is right."</p>

<p>"Why do you want her to say it?"
asked Mr. Ward.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span></p>

<p>"I was just going to tell them all
a great secret, and I wanted her to
promise, on her sacred word and
honor, she would never tell; and she
wouldn't do it."</p>

<p>"So Daisy is apt to break her promises,
is she?" said the gentleman,
with a smile at Daisy, which told very
plainly that he was only joking.</p>

<p>"Oh, no, sir!" said Minnie. "Indeed
she is not. Daisy always tells
the truth, and never does what she
says she won't; at least, we never
knew her to do it: did we, girls?"</p>

<p>A chorus of young voices was
raised in Daisy's favor.</p>

<p>"And yet you cannot trust her unless
she swears to what she promises,"
said Mr. Ward.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span></p>

<p>"Swears, sir!" said Minnie. "I'm
sure I don't want her to swear!
'Word and honor' are not bad words,
are they?"</p>

<p>"Not in themselves, certainly;"
answered Mr. Ward. "Many a thing
which is good in itself when properly
used, becomes bad and hurtful if put
to a wrong purpose. Now to swear
is to say, by some word or person
which you consider holy and sacred,
that you will or will not do, that you
have or have not done, a certain thing.
Suppose some man were accused of
a crime, and that the judge were
about to try him, and punish him if
he were guilty, and it was thought
that I knew whether or no the man
had done that of which he was accused.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
So I am called to the court,
and there made to promise that I will
tell the truth, and nothing but the
truth; and to make sure of this I am
made to lay my hand on the Bible,&mdash;God's
holy word,&mdash;and call upon
Him, to hear me tell what I know.
And this is considered a very solemn
thing, even by many who have little
care or respect for God in other ways;
and it is called swearing, or taking
the oath."</p>

<p>"They ought to be 'shamed of theirselves,"
said Lily, indignantly; "they
ought to know you would never tell a
story, papa. And to go and make you
swear too! I wouldn't do it if I was
you; but I'd tell 'em the third comman'ment,
and run away fast from
them."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span></p>

<p>"But if this is done in the fear of
God, and as a sort of prayer that He
will hear and help us to tell that
which is true, it is not taking His
name in vain, Lily," said Mr. Ward;
"and to do it falsely is considered even
by men to be a great crime. This is
called perjury; and if any one is found
guilty of it, he is severely punished by
the law. Now it may be wise, and
even necessary, for a man to take an
oath at such a time as this, when the
very life of another may depend on
whether he tells the truth or no; but
it can hardly be necessary for one
little girl at play with another to
make her promise sure by swearing
to it. For to say 'by your sacred
word and honor' is neither more nor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
less than a sort of swearing or taking
an oath that what you say is true."</p>

<p>"Then we'll make a rule not to
say it any more," said Lily. "We
didn't know it was naughty before,
papa. But please tell us now about
other words. Daisy says we mustn't
say 'mercy,' and 'gracious,' and
'heavens,' and maybe we mustn't;
but why is that swearing? Swearing
is taking God's name in vain, and
how do such words take His name
in vain if we don't speak it? And she
thinks playing with the Bible, or saying
its words when we are playing
or just talking common talk, is taking
God's name in vain, too. Is it?"</p>

<p>"I will tell you," said Mr. Ward.
"Suppose, Lily, that some great king<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
or queen, or the president of our own
country, were to come here; would
you not wish to be particularly polite
and respectful to them, both in your
manner and way of speaking?"</p>

<p>"Um-m-m, I don't know," answered
Lily, doubtfully; "not partic'lar.
I guess I'd just as lieve be saucy
to them as to any one else."</p>

<p>Mr. Ward saw this would not do,
at least, not for Lily: he must go
higher than earthly rulers.</p>

<p>"Suppose, then," he said, "that
Jesus should come down here among
us, so that we could see Him with
our eyes, walking and talking with
us, what would you all do?"</p>

<p>"I'd fall down and worship Him,"
said Minnie.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span></p>

<p>"I'd listen to every word He said,
and never speak one myself for fear
I should miss one," said Daisy; "and
then I'd remember them all the days
of my life."</p>

<p>"Dear child!" said Mr. Ward,
laying his hand fondly on hers: "I
believe you do treasure your Lord's
words and try to live according to
them."</p>

<p>"I'd ask Him to put His hand on
my head and bless me just as He did
those other little children when He
was on earth before," said Lola, softly.</p>

<p>"So would I. And I'd be glad
there were no disciples to forbid us
to come to Him," said Lily. "I
s'pose they thought Jesus wouldn't
care about children; but He did,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
didn't He? And you wouldn't think
so, papa, would you?" and the little
child laid her hand lovingly against
her father's cheek. "I'd keep very
close to Him all the time He was here,
and take fast hold of His hand, only
I wouldn't be troublesome, but just
keep as still as a mouse; and I'd give
Him every thing of mine that He
wanted."</p>

<p>"So you would all show your love
and reverence for Him by every
means in your power," said Mr.
Ward, "trying not to grieve or offend
Him by treating His name or His
presence with the least carelessness
or disrespect, but letting Him see
that you honored the one and were
blessed by the other: is it not so?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span></p>

<p>"Yes, sir," came from the older as
well as the younger children.</p>

<p>"And if, after He had gone away,
He should send you each a letter,
telling you what He wanted you to
do, how you were to love and serve
Him, and in which you would find
all the advice, help, and comfort you
might need at any time,&mdash;how would
you treat that letter?"</p>

<p>"I'd keep it all my life, and take
such good care of it," said Rosie.</p>

<p>"I'd read it, and read it, and read
it; and kiss it, and kiss it, and kiss it,"
said Lily, "and then I'd put it in my
bosom, and keep it, oh! so carefully."</p>

<p>"And so would I, and I, and I,"
said the rest, satisfied to have Lily
for spokeswoman.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span></p>

<p>"And if you saw any one misusing
that letter, how would you feel?"
asked Mr. Ward.</p>

<p>"I'd be very provoked with them,"
answered Lily, "and I think I wouldn't
love them any more, 'cept it was
you, papa, or mamma, or Elly, or any
one of my own that I <i>have</i> to love;
and then I'd cry, and ask you not to
serve my Jesus' letter so."</p>

<p>"You mean the Bible is Jesus' letter
to us: don't you, sir?" asked Daisy.</p>

<p>"Yes; and, dear children, our
Lord's presence is here among us
as much as if He were in man's
form which He once wore on earth.
His ear is as quick to hear our words
of love and praise, or those of carelessness
and disrespect, as it was then;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
His eye as ready to see the use we
make of the precious Word He has
given us. But we forget this when
we use His book more carelessly
than we would any gift from an
earthly friend, or when we take His
name lightly or without thought upon
our lips. To do this is to take it in
vain, and it displeases Him."</p>

<p>"But, Mr. Ward," said Minnie, "it
is not cursing and swearing to say
'mercy,' and 'gracious,' and 'good
Lord,' and such things, is it?"</p>

<p>"Not cursing, certainly: that is to
use God's name profanely, or to call
on Him to destroy us or other people;
and this is a most terrible sin. But,
Minnie, the use of such words in
play or thoughtlessness is a bad habit,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
and leads to worse. Suppose a man
breaks open a bank here, and takes
all the money from it: that is stealing,
is it not?"</p>

<p>"Why, yes, sir," answered Minnie.</p>

<p>"And suppose you take a sugar-plum
belonging to your sister: it is
a very small thing compared to the
money taken from the bank, but is
it not stealing, all the same?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir; and if I was to be so
bad as to take Julia's sugar-plums,
I'm afraid I'd maybe steal something
worse some time."</p>

<p>"Just so," said the gentleman; "and
now you see why it is not wise or
right to make use of such expressions.
It is, as Lily says, a kind of little
swearing, and may lead to worse.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
Besides, it is very useless. You can
surely believe one another,&mdash;unless,
indeed, it is some false and deceitful
child,&mdash;without saying 'upon your
sacred word and honor,' 'as sure as
you live,' 'Heaven knows,' and so
forth. And there is so little temptation
to fall into this sin that it seems
strange it should be so common.
There is nothing to be gained by it,
even of this world's good,&mdash;no pleasure,
no profit. It is only an idle, useless
habit, most displeasing and vexing
to the holy ear of Him whose commandment
we break without thought
or care. Goodness and mercy and
graciousness belong to the Almighty;
and so, too, we must take heed that
we do not speak of what belongs to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
Him in an irreverent, careless way.
And now I think we have had
enough talk on this subject for this
afternoon. You did not ask your
friends here that I might lecture
them."</p>

<p>"Oh, yes! I did, papa," said Lily;
"for we all deserved it very much,
'specially the big girls. But, papa,
do you believe the Lord troubles
Himself to know where the girls put
an old, worn-out cushion, and such
things; and if He does, ought we to
say He does?"</p>

<p>"God knows every thing, Lily;
even the smallest trifle is seen by
Him; but it is very wrong to say, in
a heedless way, 'the Lord knows,'
for I suppose that is what you mean.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
And this very thought, that His eye
and His ear are always with us, noticing
every word and look, knowing
the very feelings of our hearts, should
make us all the more careful how we
use His holy name. I am glad this
question has come up among you;
for heedlessness in using God's name,
and other sacred words, in quoting
Scripture,&mdash;talking Bible, my Lily
calls it,&mdash;and other such habits, were
becoming too common, I fear, among
all the young people in Glenwood;
and we older ones too, I believe, fall
too often into the custom. We have,
too many of us, constant need of the
prayer, 'Set a watch, O Lord, upon
my mouth; keep the door of my
lips.'"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span></p>

<p>"It is Daisy's doing, sir, that we
have come to think of this," said honest
Cora. "I, for one, have been
very thoughtless about offending God
in this way, and have set a bad example
to the rest. I believe the little
ones have caught it from us larger
girls, and we have to thank Daisy
that she has taught us a better lesson."</p>

<h2>VIII.<br />

<small>DAISY'S NAME.</small></h2>


<div class='drop-cap'>"INDADE, now, and hasn't me
words come true, sir? For
wasn't I afther tellin' ye she was as
nate a little lady as iver stepped in
two shoes?" said Betty Macarthy, as
she stood with her arms akimbo, her
head on one side, and her honest face
one broad glow of delight and satisfaction,
gazing at the dainty-looking
little creature who stood before her,
her young face bright with as much
pleasure as Betty's own.</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span></p>

<p>For Daisy's old friend had come
to live at Mrs. Forster's; and this
was the way it had been brought
about.</p>

<p>The lady had wanted a laundress;
and, thinking that Betty, who had
once held that post in her father's
family, might know of one, had begged
the General to ask her.</p>

<p>No sooner had he put the question
than Betty eagerly answered she
should be only too glad of the place
herself; for she was tired of her
present position, and a countrywoman
of her own was ready to take it
off her hands, stock, fixtures, goodwill,
and all. "For her heart was
sore for the child," Betty said, and to
be where she could see her every<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
day, and to live once more with "Miss
Gertrude," would be almost as much
happiness as she could wish for; and
then she would try to put Jack out
with some gardener to learn his trade,
for which he had always had a turn.</p>

<p>So the General, having talked the
matter over with his wife, and mindful
of the generous care and kindness
shown to their Daisy by these poor
people, not only told Betty she should
come to live with them, but also put
Jack under his own gardener, though
there was really no need of any more
hands about the place.</p>

<p>Thus did the "bread cast upon
the waters" by this kind-hearted
Irishwoman, come back to her, blessed
sevenfold.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span></p>

<p>Nothing was told to Daisy of this
arrangement till one afternoon, when
the General had returned from the
city, Mrs. Forster said to her, "I am
going to speak to the new laundress
and gardener's boy. Come with me,
Daisy;" and half wondering, the little
girl obeyed.</p>

<p>But her surprise soon changed into
delight and gratitude when she saw
who the new domestics were; for,
in spite of all the pleasure she felt in
her new way of life, Daisy's loving
little heart often longed for the old
friends who had been so good to her
in her time of need, and she wanted
not only to see them, but to share
some of her many comforts with
them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span></p>

<p>So you may know how glad she
was when her eye fell upon the two
figures standing by the back door,
and she knew that they had been
brought to live in the same place with
her.</p>

<p>With an excitement very unusual
in her, she flew at Betty, and, throwing
both arms about her neck, covered
her broad, smiling face with
warm kisses. Betty returned them
with a will, holding her fast in both
arms; and then, putting her from her
and looking at her from head to foot,
put on an air of strong approval, and
spoke to the General in the words
you have read at the beginning of
this chapter.</p>

<p>"An' isn't it fit for a princess, she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
is?" she continued, quite unable to
keep back her admiration and pleasure
at the child's improved appearance.
"Isn't it fit for a princess she
is; and Saacyfuts or no Saacyfuts,
isn't it a right her own folks would
have to the name if they found her
now? Sure I'd be saacy meself to
have the ownin' of a child like that.
An' her not a bit spoiled, but just as
lovin' and free-like as when she had
none but me an' Jack."</p>

<p>Then Daisy was told she might
take Betty and Jack away and show
them the neat little wash-house, shaded
by a fine clump of trees, with its
nice bleaching and drying ground
beyond, its laundry on the first floor,
and two small bedrooms above, where<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
they were to sleep. Betty was enchanted,
and expressed over and over
again her satisfaction at the change
in her life. It was far better, she
thought, to stand at the wash-tub
or ironing-table, breathing the sweet
country air, with all its pleasant sights
and sounds about her, than to do the
same at her stall in the hot, dusty,
crowded city.</p>

<p>As for Jack, when he saw the
splendid garden, when Daisy had led
them there, and knew it was to be
his privilege to work among those
lovely flowers, he could not contain
himself, but shouted and shouted,
turned somersault after somersault,
till recalled to himself by Betty's reminder
that he must "remember that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
Margaret&mdash;she begged her pardon,&mdash;Miss
Daisy&mdash;was a little lady now,
and he must mind his manners before
her."</p>

<p>But Daisy was so like her old self,
so free from any pride or haughtiness
in her new position, that Jack found
it hard to remember she was any
other than the little waif whom he
had pitied and petted for so long;
and his "manners" were brought to
his mind with much more force by
the sight of the gray-haired old Scotch
gardener under whom he was to
work, and before whom his gambols
ceased at once.</p>

<p>Meanwhile General and Mrs. Forster
were talking on a very interesting
subject, for Betty's words about<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
Daisy's lost friends had given the lady
a new idea.</p>

<p>"Frank," she said to her husband,
"did you notice what Betty said about
Daisy's friends?"</p>

<p>"Yes," he answered. "I hope she
won't turn Daisy's head and make
her vain with her praise and flattery."</p>

<p>"I'm not afraid," said his wife.
"Daisy has a right to her name, the
modest, unaffected little girl; and she
has too much sense to be spoiled by
what she looks upon only as the overflowing
of Betty's affection. But
don't you know that the Irish often
say <i>saacy</i> when they mean proud?"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes. I have often noticed it
in people of Betty's class," answered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
the General; "but what has that to
do with Daisy's friends?"</p>

<p>"Is it not possible that their name
is Proudfoot or Proudfit, and that
'Saacyfut' is Betty's way of calling
it?"</p>

<p>The General laughed heartily.</p>

<p>"Hardly, I think," he said; "and
yet&mdash;I do not know. It may be.
But it never struck me. It took a
woman's wit to think of that."</p>

<p>"We will ask Daisy when she
comes," said Mrs. Forster. "If
Proudfoot <i>was</i> their name, she must
remember it when she hears it spoken,
I think. She can hardly have forgotten
it so entirely that she would not
recognize it. And then, if it should
be so, it will be a help to find her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
friends." Mrs. Forster spoke the last
words more slowly.</p>

<p>"Yes," said her husband, giving
words to the thought which had made
her half unwilling to utter them;
"and if found, we must give up our
Daisy."</p>

<p>"But we must not seek them the
less for that," she said, "or I shall
feel as if we had found some lovely
jewel that we were striving to hide
from the rightful owner. I know
what terrible longings must fill her
mother's heart;" and a tear dropped
from Mrs. Forster's eye on her baby's
face, as she clasped it more tenderly
than ever in her arms.</p>

<p>"Daisy," said the General that
evening, as the little girl stood by his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
knee, "did you ever hear the name
of Proudfoot?"</p>

<p>Daisy started, drew a quick, gasping
breath, and suddenly threw herself
into his arms.</p>

<p>"That is it!" she cried, in a rapid,
excited manner, "that is it! That is
my name, that is what they called
papa and mamma. I never heard it
since; but I know it now. I am
Daisy Proudfoot, I am, I am!"</p>

<p>It was some time before the child's
excitement could be calmed; but
there was no farther knowledge to be
gained from her. Proudfoot was her
name, of that she was quite sure;
and the recollection of it at this late
hour seemed to fill her with a kind
of tremulous happiness; but still<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
she could not tell where she belonged.</p>

<p>Betty too, when she was asked if
Proudfoot was the name of Daisy's
mother, answered,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Sure, an' it was, ma'am. Didn't
I say so all along, only she was
always gainsayin' it?"<a name="FNanchor_A_1" id="FNanchor_A_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_1" class="fnanchor">[A]</a></p>

<p>The matter was settled; and General
Forster, loath as he was to part
with Daisy, feeling that he must
leave no stone unturned to trace her
friends, again put advertisements in
the papers, saying, that if any family
of the name of Proudfoot had had
a child supposed to be lost at sea,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
they might hear of her at such and
such a place.</p>

<p>Daisy was not told of this; she
was contented and happy in her new
home and among her new friends,
and it was not thought best to disturb
her mind with fresh hopes of finding
those who might never come to claim
her.</p>

<p>But although she was still called
Daisy Forster by all in Glenwood, it
was a satisfaction to herself and to
the kind friends who had taken her
up and cared for her, to know the
name which rightly belonged to her.</p>

<p>However, days and weeks and
months went by, and still no one
came to seek the Daisy blossom
which had been transplanted to such<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
pleasant soil. And there it grew and
flourished, and did its Master's work;
proving how much even such a simple
floweret can do by its own modest
example and teaching to win others
to honor Him.</p>

<p>It was surprising to see how much
her schoolmates thought of her opinion;
how they profited by the simple
lesson she had taught them, and tried
to break themselves of the foolish and
sinful habit into which nearly all of
them had fallen, of using sacred
names and things in such a heedless,
unthinking manner.</p>

<p>It was not only the very little girls,
but the older ones also, and even
Miss Collins herself, who learned
from our Daisy to set a watch upon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
their lips, and to remember whose
ear was ever present, hearing each
thoughtless word which dishonored
Him or that which especially belonged
to Him.</p>

<p>Perhaps they gave more heed to
Daisy's words than they would have
done to those of any other one of
their number. There was such a
half-mystery about her, and their
thoughts were so tender towards her,
that they checked their heedless
speech for her sake at first; then, as
they learned to think more about it,
for a better and higher reason, till at
last the bad habit was broken up;
and if, by chance, such a word as
"mercy," "heavens," "good Lord,"
or the like, came from the lips of any<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
child, the surprised and reproving
looks of her companions told her of
her fault, and punished her sufficiently.</p>

<p>And the good influence spread far
and wide. Since the little ones were
so careful, their parents and older
friends felt that they, too, must take
heed lest they offended in this way;
and so it came to pass that among
the families of Glenwood God's name
and word came to be held in such
true reverence and honor as had never
been before.</p>

<p>And so nearly a year passed by,
and brought the Daisy and her sister-flowerets
to another spring.</p>

<small>THE LOST FOUND.</small></h2>


<div class='drop-cap'>"IS that you, Daisy?"</div>

<p>"Yes, sir. Is that you, Uncle
Frank?" answered Daisy, playfully.</p>

<p>"Well, I thought it was this morning
when I went to town; but I am
doubtful of it now."</p>

<p>"Why?" asked Daisy, laughing, as
she reached up on tiptoe to offer the
kiss with which she always welcomed
her uncle on his return from the
city.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span></p>

<p>"Baby Daisy is not doubtful, at
least," said Mrs. Forster, coming forward,
and putting her little daughter,
all crows and smiles, in her father's
arms. "Let her pull your hair a
little to convince you of the fact."</p>

<p>"It will be difficult," said the General.
"There was a man in the cars
so like me, face, height, and figure,
that some of my friends were taking
him for me; others accusing me of
having a brother whom I have never
owned. He sat two or three seats in
front of me, and I could not help
being amused. Ward came in, nodded
familiarly to my double, with,
"How are you, General?" passed on
to me, stopped, and looked from one
to the other with a mixture of surprise<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>
and curiosity that was droll; then
asked for information which I could
not give him. It was the same with
many others. I hope the stranger
will keep himself out of mischief
while he is in Glenwood, or I may
be held responsible for his wrong doings."</p>

<p>"Did he come to Glenwood?"
asked Daisy.</p>

<p>"Yes: I left him standing on the
platform at the station, and I hardly
knew whether my own carriage belonged
to him or to me. However,
he made no claim as I stepped into
it."</p>

<p>"Who was he?" asked Mrs. Forster.
"Did not you find out?"</p>

<p>"No. No one could tell me, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
I could not go and ask the man who
he was, merely for the reason that
he resembled me so much. There,
there, little woman," as the baby gave
a vigorous pull at his hair. "I've had
enough of mamma's proofs, and am
satisfied that no other man than Frank
Forster would submit to such usage
at these tiny hands. I rather imagine
this stranger came up to look at
Beechgrove, which is to let, as I heard
him asking the railway porter in which
direction it lay, and where the agent
was to be found."</p>

<p>A fortnight went by, and nothing
more was seen of the stranger who
looked so like General Forster; nor
after that evening did the General or
his wife think of him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span></p>

<p>Not so Daisy. She thought often
of him with a kind of half wish that
she might see him; why she scarcely
knew herself, but she never spoke of
it. She was rather a shy, quiet child,
keeping her ideas and wishes pretty
much to herself, unless they were
drawn out by some one whom she
loved or trusted; and neither the General
nor Mrs. Forster suspected what
was working in her mind.</p>

<p>Her idea, too, that the General
looked so like her own papa, they
regarded only as a childish fancy,
ready to see a likeness between the
two she most admired and loved
in all the world. And they never
imagined how the child was dreaming
and wondering over this unseen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
stranger who had had such a passing
interest for them.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, it became certain that
Beechgrove, as the place was called,
was taken; for the placards advertising
it to rent were taken down,
and the house was going through
a thorough cleaning.</p>

<p>But the General and his wife, being
people who never gossiped or concerned
themselves about their neighbors'
affairs, did not trouble themselves
in the matter. And those who were
curious and asked questions received
no satisfaction from old Dr. Harding,
who had charge of the property.</p>

<p>All Miss Collins' young scholars,
however, thought themselves very
much concerned in the letting of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
Beechgrove, and with good reason.
For a large aviary belonged to the
place, containing many rare and
beautiful birds, and the former owner,
who was fond of children, often
used to invite the young people of
Glenwood to see these birds, and
to amuse themselves in other ways
about his grounds. But since Dr.
Harding had had the care of the
place, not a child had been suffered
to come within sight or hearing of
the aviary, which had a new charm
for them since it was a forbidden
pleasure.</p>

<p>So the new occupants of Beechgrove,
and the question as to whether
they were likely to recover their old
privileges there or no, had been a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
subject of great interest to our young
friends, and they were very anxious
for information on the matter.</p>

<p>One morning when Daisy came to
school, she found the rest of the
class grouped about Mattie Prime
and Rosie Pierson, who lived beyond
Beechgrove, and had to pass it on
their way to Miss Collins'.</p>

<p>"The new people have gone to
Beechgrove," said Violet Swan, when
Daisy asked what they were talking
about; "and Mattie and Rosie saw
a little girl there this morning. We
are glad there is a child there, because
maybe having her will make
the papa good to other children,
and he will let us go in and see
the birds because of her."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span></p>

<p>"She's a very little thing," said
Rosie. "She can't speak plain. Such
a crooked tongue."</p>

<p>"But she's very cunning," said
Mattie. "We were going past the
gate and she called out to us, 'Itty
dirls, itty dirls;' and when we stopped
she put her face through the rails
to kiss us, and handed us some
flowers she had. She was real
sweet."</p>

<p>"What is her name?" asked Daisy.</p>

<p>"We asked her, but we could not
make out what she said. Mamy
Modwit it sounded like; but she
did speak so crooked," said Mattie.</p>

<p>"Do you know," said Rosie, "I
think she looked like Daisy. Don't
you, Mattie?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span></p>

<p>"Why, so she does," said Mattie.
"Isn't that funny? Only Daisy's eyes
always look sorry except when she
is laughing or speaking, and that
little girl's were so full of mischief
and laughing."</p>

<p>"How big was she?" asked Lola.</p>

<p>"Oh, about as large as your sister
Bertie. Not near old enough to
come to school."</p>

<p>"I s'pose there are no other children
but her," said Fanny Delisle.
"Willie saw the family come yesterday;
and he said there were only
the lady and gentleman, and the
little girl and servants. If there
are no children as old as us, maybe
it won't come into their heads to
let us see the aviary again."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span></p>

<p>This short conversation put an end
to the half hope, half wish, that had
been in Daisy's heart. Even supposing
the stranger who looked so
like General Forster were the gentleman
who had taken Beechgrove,
he could be nothing to her (not
until now had she said even to
herself that she had hoped it might
be so), for the family did not answer
to her own. She had papa and
mamma, little brother Theodore, and
a baby sister, a very little baby;
and only this child of three years
old or more seemed to belong to
the new-comers; and she had no
sister so old.</p>

<p>Daisy reasoned this all out for
herself with a sad, disappointed little<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
heart, forgetting that time had not
stood still with her own family any
more than it had with her, and that
changes might have come to them
as well as to herself.</p>

<p>This was on Friday, and nothing
more was seen or heard of the
strangers by Daisy or her playmates,
till Sunday came. But then such
a strange and happy thing came to
pass, and in such a wonderful way.
"Just like a book thing," Lily Ward
afterwards said.</p>

<p>It was the loveliest of Sabbath days,
and every thing seemed to feel it.</p>

<p>"What day is it, Bertie?" asked
Mr. Swan, as his youngest daughter
stood on the piazza steps ready for
church.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span></p>

<p>"Jesus' happy Sunday," answered
the little one; "and, oh, didn't He
mate a nice one!"</p>

<p>Other people than Bertie thought
so; a nice one indeed.</p>

<p>It was the softest, sweetest, warmest
of May Sundays. A busy little breeze,
carrying with it the perfume of the
apple-blossoms over which it had
passed, stole in at the open windows
of the church, and wandered around
among aisles, pillars, and pews, now
fluttering the leaves of a book, now
toying with a ribbon, now tossing a
curl upon some sunny head, now
fanning some cheek flushed with a
walk in the almost summer heat.
A robin, saucy birdie, swung himself
lightly to and fro on the branch<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>
of one of the fine old elms outside
the church-door, and poured forth
his hymn of praise; while from far
and near came the answering notes
of his mates; and mingling with
his song were heard the voices of
the children in the Sunday school
beyond, as they sang the closing
hymn.</p>

<p>Then they came trooping in gently,
and with soft footsteps, as became
the house of God (honoring His
name and His word had taught
them also to honor the place where
He was worshipped), and took their
places beside their parents and
friends.</p>

<p>Watching them from one of the
pews which ran by the side of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>
pulpit, were a pair of roguish, dancing
eyes, which Rosie Pierson and
Mattie Prime recognized at once.
They were those of the little girl who
had peeped at them through the railing
of the Beechgrove grounds. Now
they were peeping over the top of the
pew-door as she stood at its foot, her
hands crossed upon it, her chin resting
upon them. What a bright, merry,
laughing face it was, and how like
Daisy's! General and Mrs. Forster
had noticed it from their seat, which
commanded a full view of that of the
strangers.</p>

<p>Beside the little girl sat a gentleman,
half turned from the congregation,
his face partly shaded by his
hand; but there could be no doubt<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>
that he was the man who was so like
the General. Mrs. Forster saw the
likeness at once, even in the turn and
shape of his head. Beyond him was
a lady in deep mourning, closely
veiled.</p>

<p>"Frank must find out who they
are," said Mrs. Forster to herself.
"That child is so like Daisy. Can it
be&mdash;oh, can it be?" Then she tried
to collect her thoughts and bring them
back to the service of Him whom she
had come to worship.</p>

<p>Daisy came in a little behind the
rest of the infant class (she had lingered
for a word with her teacher),
and took her seat. Almost immediately
her eye fell on the new-comers
to Glenwood. Mrs. Forster saw her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>
start, flush all over, neck and face,
and press her small hands tightly together,
as if trying to keep back some
exclamation which rose to her lips.</p>

<p>With a beating heart the child
watched the strangers, striving in vain
to get a better view of the face of the
gentleman, gazing from him to the
veiled lady, and then at the little
girl.</p>

<p>The bell ceased tolling, the congregation
were gathered, the hour of
service had come, and the clergyman
rose in the pulpit.</p>

<p>But at that moment the lady drew
aside her veil; and ere Dr. Parker
had opened his lips, a little voice rang
through the still church.</p>

<p>"Mamma! Oh, my own mamma!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span></p>

<p>How much was in those few words!
What a tale they told! What a world
of longing, of love, of joy, they held!</p>

<p>The stranger lady&mdash;ah! no stranger
was she to our Daisy&mdash;started to
her feet, stretched out her hands, then
with a little cry sank fainting into
the arms of the gentleman who had
also suddenly arisen.</p>

<p>She was carried out; General and
Mrs. Forster following with the excited,
trembling Daisy; and so the
father and mother found the long-lost
child.</p>

<p>Who could describe it? Who
could find words for the joy, the
wonder, the gratitude of those concerned;
who tell the sympathy which
filled the hearts of all in that congregation,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>
which dimmed their eyes with
tears, and filled their hearts with adoration,
as, before another word of the
morning service was begun, the beloved
minister called on all to render
thanks for the great and signal mercy
just shown to those long-parted parents
and their little one!</p>

<p>And now there is little more to tell.
Only how Daisy's mamma, and the
little sister whom she remembered
only as a tiny baby, had been rescued
from the sinking ship with some of
the other passengers; how, having
been unable to trace their lost treasure,
and believing that the boat, with
all whom it contained, had gone
down in the deep waters, the parents
had gone abroad, where they had remained<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>
till a few months before this
time, and so had never seen the advertisements
which might have told
them she was still living: all this
was soon explained.</p>

<p>And then Daisy must tell her story,
and Betty must come in to help her
out where memory failed and the
past was a blank, because of that long,
wasting illness. And how Betty
laughed and cried by turns, and would
hear of no praise or thanks for what
she had done, declaring that "Miss
Daisy had done her and Jack far
more good nor she resaved, taching
them to mind their tongues afore
God Almighty."</p>

<p>And though General and Mrs. Forster
must now give up, to her rightful<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span>
owners, the darling of whom they had
grown so fond, yet they did not have
to part with her altogether; for she
was so near to them that they saw
her every day; indeed, the two families
became almost as one, and Daisy
felt as if she had two homes.</p>

<p>The little brother, whom Daisy remembered
so well, had gone to a
home beyond the sky, but a few
weeks before her father and mother
came to Glenwood.</p>

<p>And so the Daisy blossom, which
had been parted from its parent stem
and cast by the wayside, where
stranger hands had gathered and
lovingly tended it, was planted once
more in the soil where it belonged,
after it had done the Master's work,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>
and scattered the good seed which
budded for His glory; proving well,
that those who "honor" the Lord
He will "delight to honor."</p>
